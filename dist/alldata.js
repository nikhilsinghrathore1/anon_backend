is a world where countless parallel processes interact within a single, cohesive computing environment, seamlessly interlinked through a native message-passing layer. It is a burgeoning ecosystem of decentralized programs, akin to the World Wide Web, where each process, like a website, operates independently yet is intricately woven into a unified experience. ao + aos: The rocket and your rocket fuel. Typically when you use ao, you will interact with it through its operating system: aos . aos is an abstraction layer that runs in your processes, making it easy to use the full functionality of the ao computer. In this cookbook, you will learn everything you need to know about getting started with the ao computer using aos. Paper If you would like to learn more about the technical specifications of ao, please check out its spec for detailed analysis.

Just make sure you have: NodeJS version 20+. (If you haven't yet installed it, check out this page to find instructions for your OS). A code editor of your choice. Installing aos Once you have NodeJS on your machine, all you need to do is install aos and run it: sh npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io After installation, we can simply run the command itself to start a new aos process! sh aos You authenticate yourself to your aos process using a keyfile. If you have an Arweave wallet you can specify it by adding a --wallet [location] flag. If you don't, a new keyfile will be generated and stored locally for you at ~/.aos.json . Welcome to the rabbit hole The utility you just started is a local client, which is ready to relay messages for you to your new process inside the ao computer. After it connects, you should see the following: Welcome to AOS : Your operating system for AO, the decentralized open access supercomputer. Type \".load-blueprint chat\" to join the community chat and ask questions! AOS Client Version : 1.12 .1. 2024 Type \"Ctrl-C\" twice to exit Your AOS process : QFt5SR6UwJSCnmgnROq62 - W8KGY9z96k1oExgn4uAzk default@aos - 0.2 .2[ Inbox : 1 ] > Welcome to your new home in the ao computer! The prompt you are now looking at is your own personal server in this decentralized machine. We will be using it to play with and explore ao in the rest of this tutorial. Sending your first command Your new personal aos process is a server that lives inside the computer, waiting to receive and execute your commands. aos loves to make things simple, so it wants to hear commands from you in the Lua programming language. Don't know Lua? Don't panic! It is a super straightforward, friendly, and fun language. We will learn it as we progress through this series. Let's break the ice and type: lua aos > \"Hello, ao!\" Then hit the \"[Enter]\" key. You should see your shell sign and post the message, request the result, then print the result as follows: lua \"Hello, ao!\" Eh. What's the big deal? Sent it a message to your process, permanently etched it into Arweave, then asked a distributed compute network to calculate its result. While the result might not look revolutionary, in reality you have done something quite extraordinary. Your process is a decentralized server that doesn't exist in any one particular place on Earth. It exists as data, replicated on Arweave between many different machines, distributed all over the world. If you wanted to, you could now attach a new compute unit to this process and recreate the state from its log of inputs (just your single command, for now) -- at any time in the future. This makes your new shell process... Resilient : There is no single place on Earth where your server actually resides. It is everywhere and nowhere -- immune from physical destruction or tampering of any kind. Permanent : Your process will never dissappear. It will always exist in its ✨holographic state✨ on Arweave, allowing you to recall it and continue playing with it. A contribution has been made to Arweave's storage endowment, so that you never have to think about upkeep or maintainance payments again. Permissionless : You did not have to register in order to start this server. Your right to use it is guaranteed by its underlying protocol (Arweave), no matter what Google, Amazon, or any other BigTech company says. Trustless : The state of your server is mathematically guaranteed . This means that you -- and everyone else -- can trust it with certainty, without even having to trust the underlying hardware it runs on. This property lets you build trustless services on top: Code that runs without any priveliged owner or controller, ruled purely by math. There is so much more to it, but these are the basics. Welcome to the ao computer, newbie! We are grateful to have you. 🫡 Next Steps In the tutorials that follow, we will explore ao and build everything from chatrooms to autonomous, decentralized bots.

Pager Previous page Welcome Next page Testnet Info \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/testnet-info/index.html\nGet involved with the ao testnet On February 27, 2024, ao Testnet was launched, for developers and early adopters to explore the hyper parallel computer. What is the ao testnet? The ao testnet is setup to allow users to interact with the ao computer without fees, to test and build towards mainnet. The best way to get involved is to build and use the ao computer with the aos console. In the Things to do section below you will find many activities to try. Installing the aos client Once you have NodeJS on your machine, all you need to do is install aos and run it: sh $ npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io Running this command at a later date will upgrade aos to the latest version. After installation, we can simply run the command itself to start a new aos process: sh $ aos This will start a process named default . See the aos guide for more details. First steps in the ao testnet Follow the tutorials and learn to build on ao . Begin Joining ao's native community chat The ao network hosts a number of chat servers that allow you to converse with other devs, right from your aos console. To load the chat client run the following: lua aos > . load - blueprint chat To show the available rooms you can run: lua aos > List () You can join a room and start chatting with other devs as follows: lua aos > Join ( \"Getting-Started\" , \"yourName\" ) aos > Say ( \"Hi\" ) Pager Previous page Welcome Next page Begin \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/welcome/testnet-info/quests.html\nQuests FAQ INFO The ao ecosystem is in a very early stage and full of opportunity. There is a community quest board full of ways that you can get involved testing and building software to grow the ecosystem, all while earning its native currency: CRED. Video Tutorial What quests are available? There is a dev chat room within ao localnet which you can query for quest information. First, launch aos : sh $ aos Next, join the Quests chatroom, if you haven't done so already. You can optionally provide your screenname/handle as the second parameter lua aos > Join ( \"Quests\" ) # OR aos > Join ( \"Quests\" , \"MyScreenName\" ) Then you can send the /Quests slash command to that chatroom. In case you have joined multiple chatrooms, the second parameter sends the message to only one specific chatroom, by name. lua aos > Say ( \"/Quests\" ) # OR aos > Say ( \"/Quests\" , \"Quests\" ) After a few seconds, a bot will respond by broadcasting the list of available quests to the chatroom. How do I view the detailed quest description? You can learn more about the details of a specific quest, by sending a /Quests:[index] slash command into the Quests chatroom, where [index] should be replaced with the quest number, for example: lua aos > Say ( \"/Quests:1\" , \"Quests\" ) # OR aos > Say ( \"/Quests:2\" , \"Quests\" ) Quest 1: \"Begin\" The detailed steps for Quest 1 are available in the Begin tutorial in this cookbook.

Processes send and receive messages rather than directly invoking functions on each other. This method allows for flexible and efficient interaction, where processes can respond to messages, enhancing the system's scalability and responsiveness. We'll begin by exploring the basics of messaging in aos , how to see messages received in your inbox, and how to send messages to other processes. Video Tutorial Step 1: Understand the Message Structure Message Basics: Messages in ao are built using Lua tables, which are versatile data structures that can hold multiple values. Within these tables, the \"Data\" field is crucial as it contains the message's content or payload. This structure allows for efficient sending and receiving of information between processes, showcasing how ao primitives leverage Arweave's underlying capabilities to facilitate complex, composable operations. For detailed specifications, please refer to the original documentation on the G8way specs page . Example : { Data = \"Hello from Process A!\" } is a simple message. Step 2: Open the aos CLI Launch the aos command-line interface (CLI) by typing aos in your terminal and pressing Enter. sh aos Step 3: How to Send a Message lua Send ({ Target = \"process ID\" , Data = \"Hello World!\" }) Send : The Send function is globally available in the aos interactive environment. Target : To send a message to a specific process, include a Target field in your message. Data : The Data is the text message you want received by the receiving process. In this example, the message is \"Hello World!\". Step 4: Store Morpheus 's Process ID We'll use the process ID provided below and store it as a variable called Morpheus. lua ajrGnUq9x9 - K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7 - IdtFa33T59b7s Copy the process ID above and store it as a variable by running the below command in the aos CLI: lua Morpheus = \"ajrGnUq9x9-K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7-IdtFa33T59b7s\" This will store the process ID as a variable called Morpheus , making it easier to interact with the specific process ID. INFO When creating the Morpheus variable, the only response you should see is undefined . This is expected. To check if the variable was created successfully, type Morpheus and press Enter. You should see the process ID you stored. Check the Morpheus Variable lua -- Check the Morpheus variable by typing Morpheus -- Expected Results: ajrGnUq9x9 - K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7 - IdtFa33T59b7s -- If \"undefined\" is returned, -- then the variable was not created successfully. Step 5: Send a Message to Morpheus After obtaining Morpheus's process ID and storing it in a variable, you're ready to communicate with it. To do this, you use the Send function. Morpheus, himself, is a parallel process running in ao. He receives and sends messages using a series of Handlers. Let's send him a message and see what happens. lua Send ({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Morpheus?\" }) Your Target is Morpheus which is the variable we defined earlier using Morpheus 's process ID. The Data is the message you want to send to Morpheus. In this case, it's \"Morpheus?\". Expected Results: lua -- Your Message Command Send ({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Morpheus?\" }) -- Message is added to the outbox message added to outbox -- A New Message is received from \"morpheus\"'s process ID New Message From BWM ... ulw : Data = I am here. You are f You've sent a message to Morpheus and received a response, but you can't read the full message. Let's learn about the Inbox and how to read messages. Step 6: The Inbox The Inbox is where you receive messages from other processes. INFO To see an in depth view of an inbox message, head over to the Messages Concepts page. Let's check your inbox to see how many messages you have received. Inside your aos CLI, type the following command: lua # Inbox If you're actively following through the tutorial, the inbox will not have many messages. However, if you've been experimenting with the aos environment, you may more than 1 message in your inbox. Example Return: lua -- Your Inbox Command # Inbox -- The command will return the number of messages in your inbox. 4 In the example above, the return is 4 , stating that there are four messages in the inbox. As we're actively looking for Morpheus 's response, we'll assume his message was the last one received. To read the last message in your inbox, type the following command: lua Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data This command allows you to isolate the Data from the message and only read the contents of the data. The Expected Return: lua -- Your Inbox[x].Data Command Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data -- The command will return the \"Data\" of the message. -- Data is what usually represents the text-based message -- received from one process to another. I am here. You are finally awake. Are you ready to see how far the rabbit hole goes? You are now using your own process to communicate with Morpheus, another parallel process running in ao. You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial. Step 7: Sending Messages with Tags Purpose of Tags : Tags in aos messages are used to categorize, route, and process messages efficiently. They play a crucial role in message handling, especially when dealing with multiple processes or complex workflows. Some processes use Handlers that specifically interact with messages that have certain tags. For example, a process may have a handler that only interacts with messages that have a specific tag, which we'll see an example of in the chatroom tutorial. How to Use Tags in Messages In the case of Morpheus, we can use tags to categorize our messages, and because Morpheus is a autonomous process, he has handlers that can interact with messages that have certain tags. Adding Tags to a Message : We already know that the Data of a message is the text-based message you want to send to another process. Earlier, we sent a message to Morpheus without any tags, in which he used a handler to respond to an exact matching data. Let's Show Morpheus That We're Ready Send Morpheus a message with the tag Action and the value rabbithole . Example: lua Send ({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Code: rabbithole\" , Action = \"Unlock\" }) Read the message from Morpheus: lua Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data Expected Return: Additional Tips for Using Tags Consistent Tagging : Develop a consistent tagging system for your application to make message handling more predictable. Tag Naming : Choose clear and descriptive names for your tags. This makes it easier to understand the purpose and context of messages at a glance. Security with Tags : Remember that tags are not encrypted or hidden, so avoid using sensitive information as tags. Advanced Usage of Tags Workflow Management : Tags can be instrumental in managing workflows, especially in systems where messages pass through multiple stages or processes. Additional Tips for Messaging Message Structure : Explore other fields like Epoch , From , and Nonce for more complex messaging needs. Debugging : Use the Dump function to print messages for debugging. Security Considerations : Be cautious with the content and handling of messages, and never send anything considered private or sensitive. Conclusion You've now learned how to send messages with tags, which is a powerful tool for categorizing and routing messages in aos. Morpheus has officially invited you to the next stage of your journey. You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial, Creating a Chatroom . Pager Previous page Preparations Next page Create a Chatroom \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/begin/chatroom.html\nBuilding a Chatroom in aos INFO If you've found yourself wanting to learn how to create a chatroom within ao , then that means we understand at least the basic methodology of sending and receiving messages. If not, it's suggested that you review the Messaging tutorial before proceeding. In this tutorial, we'll be building a chatroom within ao using the Lua scripting language. The chatroom will feature two primary functions: Register : Allows processes to join the chatroom. Broadcast : Sends messages from one process to all registered participants. Let's begin by setting up the foundation for our chatroom. Video Tutorial Step 1: The Foundation Open your preferred code editor, e.g. VS Code. INFO You may find it helpful to have the Recommended Extensions installed in your code editor to enhance your Lua scripting experience. Create a new file named chatroom.lua . Step 2: Creating The Member List In chatroom.lua , you'll begin by initializing a list to track participants: lua Members = Members or {} Save the chatroom.lua file Step 3: Load the Chatroom into aos With chatroom.lua saved, you'll now load the chatroom into aos . If you haven't already, start your aos in your terminal inside the directory where chatroom.lua is saved In the aos CLI, type the following script to incorporate your script into the aos process: lua . load chatroom. lua As the screenshot above shows, you may receive undefined as a response. This is expected, but we still want to make sure the file loaded correctly. INFO In the Lua Eval environment of aos, when you execute a piece of code that doesn't explicitly return a value, undefined is a standard response, indicating that no result was returned. This can be observed when loading resources or executing operations. For instance, executing X = 1 will yield undefined because the statement does not include a return statement. However, if you execute X = 1; return X , the environment will return the value 1 . This behavior is essential to understand when working within this framework, as it helps clarify the distinction between executing commands that modify state versus those intended to produce a direct output. Type Members , or whatever you named your user list, in aos . It should return an empty array { } . If you see an empty array, then your script has been successfully loaded into aos . Step 4: Creating Chatroom Functionalities The Registration Handler The register handler will allow processes to join the chatroom. Adding a Register Handler: Modify chatroom.lua to include a handler for Members to register to the chatroom with the following code: lua -- Modify \"chatroom.lua\" to include a handler for \"Mmebers\" -- to register to the chatroom with the following code: handlers.add ( \"Register\" , { Action = \"Register\" }, function (msg) table.insert (Members, msg. From ) print (msg. From .. \" Registered\" ) msg. reply ({ Data = \"Registered.\" }) end ) This handler will allow processes to register to the chatroom by responding to the tag Action = \"Register\" . A printed message will confirm stating registered will appear when the registration is successful. Reload and Test: Let's reload and test the script by registering ourselves to the chatroom. Save and reload the script in aos using .load chatroom.lua . Check to see if the register handler loaded with the following script: lua Handlers. list This will return a list of all the handlers in the chatroom. Since this is most likely your first time developing in aos , you should only see one handler with the name Register . Let's test the registration process by registering ourselves to the chatroom: lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Register\" }) If successful, you should see that there was a message added to your outbox and that you then see a new printed message that says registered . Finally, let's check to see if we were successfully added to the Members list: lua Members If successful, you'll now see your process ID in the Members list. Adding a Broadcast Handler Now that you have a chatroom, let's create a handler that will allow you to broadcast messages to all members of the chatroom. Add the following handler to the chatroom.lua file: lua handlers.add ( \"Broadcast\" , { Action = \"Broadcast\" }, function (msg) for _, recipient in ipairs (Members) do ao. send ({Target = recipient, Data = msg. Data }) end msg. reply ({Data = \"Broadcasted.\" }) end ) This handler will allow you to broadcast messages to all members of the chatroom. Save and reload the script in aos using .load chatroom.lua . Let's test the broadcast handler by sending a message to the chatroom: lua Send ({Target = ao. id , Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"Broadcasting My 1st Message\" }). receive (). Data Step 5: Inviting Morpheus to the Chatroom Now that you've successfully registered yourself to the chatroom, let's invite Morpheus to join us. To do this, we'll send an invite to him that will allow him to register to the chatroom. Morpheus is an autonomous agent with a handler that will respond to the tag Action = \"Join\" , in which will then have him use your Register tag to register to the chatroom. Let's send Morpheus an invitation to join the chatroom: lua Send ({ Target = Morpheus, Action = \"Join\" }) To confirm that Morpheus has joined the chatroom, check the Members list: lua Members If successful, you'll receive a broadcasted message from Morpheus. Step 6: Inviting Trinity to the Chatroom Within this message, he'll give you Trinity's process ID and tell you to invite her to the chatroom. Use the same processes to save her process ID as Trinity and to invite her to the chatroom as you did with Morpheus. If she successfully joins the chatroom, she'll then pose the next challenge to you, creating a token . Engaging Others in the Chatroom Onboarding Others Invite aos Users: Encourage other aos users to join your chatroom. They can register and participate in the broadcast. Provide Onboarding Instructions: Share a simple script with them for easy onboarding: lua -- Hey, let's chat on aos! Join my chatroom by sending this command in your aos environment: Send ({ Target = [Your Process ID], Action = \"Register\" }) -- Then, you can broadcast messages using: Send ({Target = [Your Process ID], Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"Your Message\" }) Next Steps Congratulations! You've successfully built a chatroom in ao and have invited Morpheus to join you. You've also created a broadcast handler to send messages to all members of the chatroom. Next, you'll continue to engage with Morpheus, but this time you'll be adding Trinity to the conversation. She will lead you through the next set of challenges. Good Luck! Pager Previous page Messaging Next page Build a Token \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/begin/token.html\nCrafting a Token INFO Diving deeper into the ao , you're now ready to create your own token, a symbol of value and exchange within this decentralized medium. If you've found yourself wanting to learn how to create a token, but haven't visited the Messaging and Build a Chatroom lessons, be sure to do so as this page is part of a multi-part interactive tutorial. When creating tokens, we'll continue to use the Lua Language within ao to mint a token, guided by the principles outlined in the Token Specification . Video Tutorial Continuing Down the Rabbit Hole In our last tutorial, Build a Chatroom , we learned how to create a chatroom within ao , invited both Morpheus and Trinity to the chatroom we created, and then Trinity has now asked for us to create a token for her as a way of proving ourselves worthy of continuing down the rabbit hole. Let us begin. The Two Paths To Building a Token There are two paths to take when building a token: The Blueprint : This is a predesigned template that helps you quickly build a token in ao . It is a great way to get started and can be customized to fit your needs. Check here to learn more about the Token Blueprint . The Manual Method : This is a step-by-step guide to building a token in ao from scratch. This path is for those who want to understand the inner workings of a token and how to build one from the ground up. Check here to review the full Build a Token guide. The Blueprint Method For this tutorial, we'll be using the Token Blueprint to create a token for Trinity . This is a predesigned template that helps you quickly build a token in ao . How To Use The Token Blueprint Make sure we're in the same directory as before during the previous steps in the tutorial. Open the Terminal. Start your aos process. Type in .load-blueprint token This will load the required handlers for the tutorials token within ao . It's important to note that the token blueprint isn't specific to this tutorial and can be used as a foundation for any token you wish to create. Verify the Blueprint is Loaded Type in Handlers.list to see the newly loaded handlers. You should see a new list of handlers that have been loaded into your aos process. If you've been following along the with the previous steps in the tutorial, you should also see the handlers for your chatroom, as well. Example: Testing the Token Now that the token blueprint is loaded, we can test the token by sending a message to ourselves using the Action = \"Info\" tag. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Info\" }). receive (). Tags This will print the token information to the console. It should show your process ID with the total balance of tokens available. Sending Tokens to Trinity Now that we've tested the token and it's working as expected, we can send some tokens to Trinity . We'll send 1000 tokens to Trinity using the Action = \"Transfer\" tag. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Transfer\" , Recipient = Trinity, Quantity = \"1000\" }). receive (). Data When Trinity receives the tokens, she'll respond to the transfer with a message to confirm that she's received the tokens. Her response will look something like this: Trinity: \"Token received. Interesting. I wasn't sure you'd make it this far. I'm impressed, but we are not done yet. I want you to use this token to tokengate the chatroom. Do that, and then I will believe you could be the one.\" You've completed the process of creating a token and sending it to Trinity . You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial. Tokengating the Chatroom . Pager Previous page Create a Chatroom Next page Tokengating \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/begin/tokengating.html\nTokengating the Chatroom INFO Now that we've created a token and sent it to Trinity , we can use the token to tokengate our chatroom. This will allow only those who have the token to enter the chatroom. Video Tutorial How to Tokengate the Chatroom Let's create a handler that will allow us to tokengate the chatroom. This handler will respond to the tag Action = \"Broadcast\" meaning it will replace the original Broadcast handler we built for our chatroom. Step 1: Start the same aos process. Be sure you're using the same aos process that you've used throughout the tutorial. Step 2: Open the chatroom.lua file. This is the same file we used to create the chatroom during the chatroom tutorial. Step 3: Edit your Broadcast handler. Replace the original Broadcast handler with the following code: lua handlers.add ( \"Broadcast\" , { Action = \"Broadcast\" }, function (m) if Balances[m. From ] == nil or tonumber (Balances[m. From ]) < 1 then print ( \"UNAUTH REQ: \" .. m. From ) return end local type = m. Type or \"Normal\" print ( \"Broadcasting message from \" .. m. From .. \". Content: \" .. m. Data ) for i = 1 , # Members, 1 do ao. send ({ Target = Members[i], Action = \"Broadcasted\" , Broadcaster = m. From , Data = m. Data }) end end ) This handler will now check the balance of the sender's token before broadcasting the message to the chatroom. If the sender doesn't have a token, the message will not be broadcasted. Save the file. Step 4: Reload the chatroom.lua file. To replace the original broadcast handler with the new one, you'll need to reload the chatroom.lua file. lua . load chatroom. lua Step 5: Test the Tokengate Now that the chatroom is tokengated, let's test it by sending a message to the chatroom. From the original aos process First, we'll test it from the original aos process. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"Hello\" }) Expected Results: { output = \"Message added to outbox\", ... } Broadcasting message from [Your Process ID]. Content: Hello. New Message From [Your Process ID]: Action = Broadcasted Testing from another Process ID. From a new aos process Now, let's test it from a new aos process that doesn't have a token. sh aos chatroom-no-token # the \"chatroom-no-token\" is the new process name We'll first need to register to the chatroom. lua . load chatroom. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Register\" }) Expected Results: message added to outbox New Message From [Your Process ID]: Data = registered Now, let's try to send a message to the chatroom. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"Hello?\" }) Expected Results: message added to outbox UNAUTH REQ: [New Process ID] As you can see, the message was not broadcasted because the new process doesn't have a token. Tell Trinity \"It is done\" From the original aos process, send a broadcast message to the chatroom saying, \"It is done\". lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"It is done\" }) WARNING It's important to be aware of exact match data and case sensitivity. If you're not receiving a response from either Morpheus or Trinity, be sure to check the the content of your Data and Tags. Trinity will then respond to the chatroom being tokengated. Expected Results: Trinity will send a message saying, \"I guess Morpheus was right. You are the one. Consider me impressed. You are now ready to join The Construct, an exclusive chatroom available to only those that have completed this tutorial. Now, go join the others by using the same tag you used Register , with this process ID: [Construct Process ID] Good luck. -Trinity\". Additionally, a footer will follow the message. Conclusion You've done it! You've successfully tokengated the chatroom. This has now unlocked access to the Construct , where only those that have fully completed this tutorial can enter. Congratulations! You've shown a great deal of promise. I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial. You're now ready to build freely in ao .

You've been powering through tutorials like a champ! Now, let's take a refreshing break and dive into something exciting. How about a game that adds a dash of fun to your learning journey? What's the game? ao-effect is a game where you can compete with friends or other players globally, in real-time, right from your terminal. We've set up a global game process for this adventure. The rules are simple. Each player starts on a 40x40 grid with health at 100 and energy at 0. Your energy replenishes over time to a maximum of 100. Navigate the grid, find other players, and use your energy to attack when they're within range. The battle continues until only one player remains or the allotted time expires. Checkout the guides on the Mechanics of the Arena and Expanding the Arena for a deeper understanding of the game. Heads Up: Don't sweat it if some command syntax seem unfamiliar. Focus on understanding the purpose of each command at a high level and, most importantly, enjoy the game! Preparing for an Adventure in ao-effect To join this global escapade, you'll need to set things up. Don't worry, it's as easy as 1-2-3! Install aos Fire up your terminal and run: bash npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io Launch aos Next, create your instance of aos: bash aos Set Up the Game ID Let's keep our game server ID handy for quick access: lua Game = \"tm1jYBC0F2gTZ0EuUQKq5q_esxITDFkAG6QEpLbpI9I\" Print Game Announcements Directly To Terminal (Optional) Here's how you can write a handler for printing announcement details: This is temporary as we will be loading this via a lua script in the next section. lua handlers.add ( \"PrintAnnouncements\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\" }) print (msg. Event .. \": \" .. msg. Data ) end ) And voilà! You're all set to join the game. How to Register for a Game Ready to jump in? Just a few simple steps to get you going: Register with the Game Server All communication between processes in ao occurs through messages. To register, send this message to the game server: lua Send ({ Target = Game, Action = \"Register\" }) -- Expected Result -- { output = \"Message added to outbox\" , onReply = function : 0x29e5ac0 , receive = function : 0x29fe440 } New Message From tm1 ... I9I : Action = Registered New Player Registered : a1b ... y1z has joined in waiting. This places you in the Waiting Lobby. A small fee is needed to confirm your spot. Confirm your spot In order to confirm your spot you need some tokens. You can acquire them by sending the following message to the game: lua Send ({ Target = Game, Action = \"RequestTokens\" }). receive (). Data -- Expected Result -- You received 10000000 from a1b2C3d4e5F6g7h8IjkLm0nOpqR8s7t6U5v4w3X2y1z NOTE The .receive().Data will wait for a response by adding a temporary Handler that only runs once and will print the response Data. If you would like to instead just wait for the response to hit your Inbox you can call Send() without .receive() and run Inbox[#Inbox].Data to see the response Data . Handler added by .receive() : { name = \"_once_0\", maxRuns = 1, pattern = { }, handle = function: 0x2925700 } Once you receive the tokens, confirm your spot by paying the game's entry fee like this: lua Send ({ Target = Game, Action = \"Transfer\" , Recipient = Game, Quantity = \"1000\" }). receive (). Data -- Expected Result -- You transferred 1000 to tm1jYBC0F2gTZ0EuUQKq5q_esxITDFkAG6QEpLbpI9I New Message From tm1 ... I9I : Action = Payment - Received Wait for a few seconds, and you'll see live updates in your terminal about player payments and statuses. Let the Games Begin! Game Mechanics Game Start: The game begins after a 2-minute WaitTime if at least 2 players have paid. Non-paying players are removed. If not enough players pay, those who did are refunded. Players spawn at a random grid point once the game begins. It's Your Move! Making a Move: The first thing you can do is move around, no energy required! You can shift one square in any direction – up, down, left, right, or diagonally. Along with the direction you must also pass in your player id to help the game identify your move. Here's how: lua Send ({ Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\" , Player = ao. id , Direction = \"DownRight\" }) The available moves across the grid are as follows: lua Up = {x = 0 , y = - 1 }, Down = {x = 0 , y = 1 }, Left = {x = - 1 , y = 0 }, Right = {x = 1 , y = 0 }, UpRight = {x = 1 , y = - 1 }, UpLeft = {x = - 1 , y = - 1 }, DownRight = {x = 1 , y = 1 }, DownLeft = {x = - 1 , y = 1 } Keep in Mind: Directions are case sensitive! If you move off the grid, you'll pop up on the opposite side. Time to Strike! Launching an Attack: As the game progresses, you'll accumulate energy. Use it to attack other players within a 3x3 grid range. Your attack won't hurt you, but it will affect others in range. lua Send ({ Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\" , Player = ao. id , AttackEnergy = \"energy_integer\" }) Health starts at 100 and decreases with hits from other players. Reach 0, and it's game over for you. Wrapping Up The game ends when there's one player left or time is up. Winners receive rewards, then it's back to the lobby for another round. Enjoyed the game? What if there was a way to make your experience even better or boost your odds of winning. Checkout the next guide to find out 🤔 Pager Previous page Bots and Games Next page Interpreting Announcements \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/announcements.html\nInterpreting Announcements Welcome back to your coding journey. It's time to use the skills you've acquired from previous tutorials to enhance your gaming experience. During the game, you've likely noticed announcements appearing in your terminal. These announcements are the game's way of communicating important events to players. However, these messages can sometimes seem cryptic or you might find yourself checking your inbox frequently for further details. Wouldn't it be convenient to access this information directly from your terminal? Well, there's a way to do that! By using handlers , you can create an autonomous agent to retrieve this information for you, marking the progression from simple bots to entities capable of interpreting and acting on game events directly. Setting up the Development Environment Start by creating a new file named bot.lua in your preferred directory. Ideally, this file should be placed in the same directory where your player process runs to ease the loading of the code. Else, you'll need to use relative paths to access the file. Writing the Code Let's dive into the logic. Each handler in aos requires three key pieces of information: name : A unique name for the handler pattern : A pattern for the handler to identify, triggering its operation handle : The operations to perform when the desired pattern is found. Here's how you can write a handler for printing announcement details: lua -- Handler to print game announcements directly in the terminal. handlers.add ( \"PrintAnnouncements\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) print (msg. Event .. \": \" .. msg. Data ) end ) In this case, the name of the handler is \"PrintAnnouncements\" . It uses a special in-built utility ( hasMatchingTags ) represented by { Action = \"Announcement\" } to check if the incoming message has been tagged as an announcement. If true, the handler prints the Event and Data, which represent the title and description of the announcement. NOTE Once a message is \"handled\", it will be discarded from your Inbox . Loading and Testing Now, let's bring this to life in the game. Navigate to your aos player terminal and enter a game session. Activate the handler by loading your bot.lua file with: lua . load bot. lua You'll now see game announcements appear directly in your terminal, offering real-time insights without the need to sift through your inbox. Congratulations! You have just taken the first step in building a bot on aos . But let's keep working on adding more features to it 🌐 Pager Previous page Let's Play A Game Next page Fetching Game State \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/game-state.html\nFetching Game State Now that you're seeing game announcements directly in your terminal, you have a better grasp of the game's dynamics. However, these insights are limited to specific actions occurring within the game. Wouldn't it be more useful to have on-demand access to comprehensive game data, like the positions, health, and energy of all players? This information could significantly improve your strategic planning, helping you assess threats, opportunities, and timing more effectively. If you thought of adding another handler to the bot created in the previous guide , you're absolutely right! Writing the Code Go back to your bot.lua file and update your existing handler as follows: lua handlers.add ( \"HandleAnnouncements\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\" }) print (msg. Event .. \": \" .. msg. Data ) end ) Adjustments to your handler include: Renaming to \"HandleAnnouncements\" to reflect its broader role. Addition of an extra operation to request the game for the updated state. The game is designed to respond to the GetGameState action tag. When you get a print of the announcement, you can check the latest message in your Inbox as follows: lua Inbox[ # Inbox] The Data field of this message contains the latest state of the game which includes: GameMode : Whether the game is in Waiting or Playing state. TimeRemaining : The time remaining for the game to start or end. Players : A table containing every player's stats like position, health and energy. But this can be taken a step further so that you can not just read but also use information from the latest state for other automations. Let's define a new variable that stores the latest state as follows: lua LatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil The syntax preserves exisitng values of the variable when you load successive iterations of the bot.lua file in your terminal, instead of overwriting it. If there is no pre-existing value then a nil value is assigned to the variable. Then implement another handler as follows: lua -- Handler to update the game state upon receiving game state information. handlers.add ( \"UpdateGameState\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) local json = require ( \"json\" ) LatestGameState = json. decode (msg. Data ) ao. send ({Target = ao. id , Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" }) print ( \"Game state updated. Print \\' LatestGameState \\' for detailed view.\" ) end ) The response from the game process from the previous handler has an action tag with the value GameState that helps us trigger this second handler. Once triggered, the handle function loads the in-built json package that parses the data into json and stores it in the LatestGameState variable. This handler additionally sends a message to your process indicating when the state has been updated. The significance of this feature will be explained in the following section. You can refer to the latest code for bot.lua in the dropdown below: Updated bot.lua file lua LatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil handlers.add ( \"HandleAnnouncements\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\" }) print (msg. Event .. \": \" .. msg. Data ) end ) handlers.add ( \"UpdateGameState\" , { Action = \"GameState\" }, function (msg) local json = require ( \"json\" ) LatestGameState = json. decode (msg. Data ) ao. send ({Target = ao. id , Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" }) print ( \"Game state updated. Print \\' LatestGameState \\' for detailed view.\" ) end ) Loading and Testing As usual, to test this new feature, load the file in your aos player terminal as follows: lua . load bot. lua Then check the LatestStateVariable to see if it has updated correctly by simply passing its name as follows: lua LatestGameState With real-time access to the latest state of the game you bot is equipped to make informed decisions decide your next action. Next let's try automating actions with the help of this data 🚶 Pager Previous page Interpreting Announcements Next page Strategic Decisions \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/decisions.html\nStrategic Decicions With the latest game state at your disposal, your bot can evolve into an autonomous agent . This transition marks an upgrade in functionality, enabling not just reactions to game states but strategic actions that consider context, energy, and proximity to make decisions. Writing the Code Return to your bot.lua file and add the following functions: lua -- Determines proximity between two points. function inRange (x1, y1, x2, y2, range) return math.abs (x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs (y1 - y2) <= range end -- Strategically decides on the next move based on proximity and energy. function decideNextAction () local player = LatestGameState. Players [ao. id ] local targetInRange = false for target, state in pairs (LatestGameState. Players ) do if target ~= ao. id and inRange (player. x , player. y , state. x , state. y , 1 ) then targetInRange = true break end end if player. energy > 5 and targetInRange then print ( \"Player in range. Attacking.\" ) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\" , Player = ao. id , AttackEnergy = tostring (player. energy )}) else print ( \"No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.\" ) local directionMap = { \"Up\" , \"Down\" , \"Left\" , \"Right\" , \"UpRight\" , \"UpLeft\" , \"DownRight\" , \"DownLeft\" } local randomIndex = math.random ( # directionMap) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\" , Player = ao. id , Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]}) end end The decideNextAction function is now a testament to our agent's ability to think and act based on a comprehensive understanding of its environment. It analyzes the latest game state to either attack if you have sufficient energy and an opponent is inRange or move otherwise. Now all you need is a handler to make sure this function runs on its own. lua handlers.add ( \"decideNextAction\" , { Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" }, function () if LatestGameState. GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then return end print ( \"Deciding next action.\" ) decideNextAction () end ) This handler triggers upon receiving a message that the latest game state has been fetched and updated. An action is taken only when the game is in Playing mode. You can refer to the latest code for bot.lua in the dropdown below: Updated bot.lua file lua LatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil function inRange (x1, y1, x2, y2, range) return math.abs (x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs (y1 - y2) <= range end function decideNextAction () local player = LatestGameState. Players [ao. id ] local targetInRange = false for target, state in pairs (LatestGameState. Players ) do if target ~= ao. id and inRange (player. x , player. y , state. x , state. y , 1 ) then targetInRange = true break end end if player. energy > 5 and targetInRange then print ( \"Player in range. Attacking.\" ) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\" , Player = ao. id , AttackEnergy = tostring (player. energy )}) else print ( \"No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.\" ) local directionMap = { \"Up\" , \"Down\" , \"Left\" , \"Right\" , \"UpRight\" , \"UpLeft\" , \"DownRight\" , \"DownLeft\" } local randomIndex = math.random ( # directionMap) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\" , Player = ao. id , Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]}) end end handlers.add ( \"HandleAnnouncements\" , { Action = \"Announcement\" }, function (msg) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\" }) print (msg. Event .. \": \" .. msg. Data ) end ) handlers.add ( \"UpdateGameState\" , { Action = \"GameState\" }, function (msg) local json = require ( \"json\" ) LatestGameState = json. decode (msg. Data ) ao. send ({Target = ao. id , Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" }) end ) handlers.add ( \"decideNextAction\" , { Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" }, function () if LatestGameState. GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then return end print ( \"Deciding next action.\" ) decideNextAction () end ) Loading and Testing Once again, to test out the latest upgrades, load the file in your aos player terminal as follows: lua . load bot. lua Observe your process output to see the decisions your autonomous agent makes in real-time, leveraging the current game state for strategic advantage. But what if another player attacks you and runs away while you are deciding the next move? In the next section you'll learn to automatically counter as soon as you have been attacked 🤺 Pager Previous page Fetching Game State Next page Automated Responses \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/attacking.html\nAutomated Responses Following our last guide , our creation has progressed from a simple bot to a sophisticated autonomous agent. Now, let's further enhance its capabilities by adding a counterattack feature, allowing it to instantly retaliate against an opponent's attack, potentially catching them off-guard before they can retreat to safety. Writing the code Add the following handler to your bot.lua file and you're set: lua -- Handler to automatically attack when hit by another player. handlers.add ( \"ReturnAttack\" , { Action = \"Hit\" }, function (msg) local playerEnergy = LatestGameState. Players [ao. id ]. energy if playerEnergy == undefined then print ( \"Unable to read energy.\" ) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"Attack-Failed\" , Reason = \"Unable to read energy.\" }) elseif playerEnergy == 0 then print ( \"Player has insufficient energy.\" ) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"Attack-Failed\" , Reason = \"Player has no energy.\" }) else print ( \"Returning attack.\" ) ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\" , Player = ao. id , AttackEnergy = tostring (playerEnergy)}) end InAction = false ao. send ({Target = ao. id , Action = \"Tick\" }) end ) Whenever your player is under attack you receive a message with the Action Hit . This setup ensures your agent can make a swift counter attack, given it has sufficient energy. You can refer to the latest code for bot.lua in the dropdown below: Updated bot.lua file lua LatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil function inRange (x1, y1, x2, y2, range) return math.abs (x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs (y1 - y2) <= range end function decideNextAction () local player = LatestGameState. Players [ao. id ] local targetInRange = false for target, state in pairs (LatestGameState.

This feature showcases the agent's evolving strategic depth and autonomy. In the upcoming section, we'll consolidate all the knowledge we've gathered so far and add some features for optimization. Pager Previous page Strategic Decisions Next page Bringing it Together \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/bringing-together.html\nBringing it Together This final guide wraps up our series, where you've built up an autonomous agent piece by piece. Now, let's refine your agent with some optimizations that fine-tune its operations. Here's a quick overview of the key improvements made: Sequential Command Execution: The introduction of an InAction flag ensures that your agent's actions are sequential (next action occurs only when the previous is successfully executed). This critical addition prevents your agent from acting on outdated game states, enhancing its responsiveness and accuracy. The full implementation can be found in the final code for the bot.lua file below. lua InAction = InAction or false -- Prevents the agent from taking multiple actions at once. Dynamic State Updates and Decisions: The agent now employs an automatic tick logic, allowing for dynamic updates and decisions. This logic enables the agent to self-trigger state updates and make subsequent decisions either upon receiving a Tick message or upon completing an action, promoting autonomous operation. lua handlers.add ( \"GetGameStateOnTick\" , { Action = \"Tick\" }, function () if not InAction then InAction = true ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\" }) end end ) Automated Fee Transfer: To further streamline its operation and ensure uninterrupted participation in games, the autonomous agent now autonomously handles the transfer of confirmation fees. lua handlers.add ( \"AutoPay\" , { Action = \"AutoPay\" }, function () ao. send ({Target = Game, Action = \"Transfer\" , Recipient = Game, Quantity = \"1000\" }) end ) In addition to these features, we've also added a logging function for debugging purposes and colored prints for better comprehension of game events. These enhancements collectively make your autonomous agent more efficient and adaptable in the game environment. Check out the complete bot.lua code in the dropdown below, with all new additions highlighted accordingly: Updated bot.lua file lua -- Initializing global variables to store the latest game state and game host process.

Let's see what you can create! 🕹️ Pager Previous page Automated Responses Next page Mechanics of the Arena \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/tutorials/bots-and-games/arena-mechanics.html\nMechanics of the Arena This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanics essential for designing and managing arena-style games in aos . In arena games, participants engage in rounds, strategically vying to eliminate each other until a sole victor emerges. The framework presented here lays the groundwork for crafting a wide range of games, all sharing the same core functionalities. Explore the intricacies of game development and unleash your creativity within this versatile arena. Core Functionalities Now, let's dive into the core functionalities that power arena-style games: Game Progression Modes: Arena games are structured into rounds that operate in a loop with the following progression modes: \"Not-Started\" → \"Waiting\" → \"Playing\" → [Someone wins or timeout] → \"Waiting\" ... NOTE The loop timesout if there are not enough players to start a game after the waiting state. Rounds offer a defined timeframe for players to engage, intensifying the excitement of gameplay. Token Stakes: Players must deposit a specified quantity of tokens (defined by PaymentQty ) to participate in the game. These tokens add a tangible stake element to the game. Bonus Rewards: Beyond the thrill of victory, players are enticed by the prospect of extra rewards. The builder has the flexibility to offer bonus tokens, defined by BonusQty , to be distributed per round. Any bets placed by players are also added to these bonuses. These bonuses serve as an additional incentive, enhancing the competitive spirit of the gameplay. Player Management: Players waiting to join the next game are tracked in the Waiting table. Active players and their game states are stored in the Players table. Eliminated players are promptly removed from the Players table and placed in the Waiting table for the next game. Round Winner Reward: When a player eliminates another, they earn not only bragging rights but also the eliminated player's deposit tokens as a reward. Additionally, winners of each round share a portion of the bonus tokens, as well as their original stake, further motivating players to strive for victory. Listener Mode: For those who prefer to watch the action unfold, the \"Listen\" mode offers an opportunity to stay informed without active participation. Processes can register as listeners, granting them access to all announcements from the game. While they do not engage as players, listeners can continue to observe the game's progress unless they explicitly request removal. Game State Management: To maintain the flow and fairness of arena games, an automated system oversees game state transitions. These transitions encompass waiting, playing, and ending phases. Time durations for each state, such as WaitTime and GameTime , ensure that rounds adhere to defined timeframes, preventing games from lasting indefinitely. You can refer to the code for the arena in the dropdown below: Arena Game Blueprint lua -- ARENA GAME BLUEPRINT. -- This blueprint provides the framework to operate an 'arena' style game -- inside an ao process. Games are played in rounds, where players aim to -- eliminate one another until only one remains, or until the game time -- has elapsed. The game process will play rounds indefinitely as players join -- and leave. -- When a player eliminates another, they receive the eliminated player's deposit token -- as a reward. Additionally, the builder can provide a bonus of these tokens -- to be distributed per round as an additional incentive. If the intended -- player type in the game is a bot, providing an additional 'bonus' -- creates an opportunity for coders to 'mine' the process's -- tokens by competing to produce the best agent. -- The builder can also provide other handlers that allow players to perform -- actions in the game, calling 'eliminatePlayer()' at the appropriate moment -- in their game logic to control the framework. -- Processes can also register in a 'Listen' mode, where they will receive -- all announcements from the game, but are not considered for entry into the -- rounds themselves.

In this guide, we'll take you through the process of creating the \"ao-effect\" game , which you experienced at the beginning of this chapter. As you progress through this example, you'll gain insights into structuring your game's logic and interacting with the arena's core code. Whether you're a seasoned developer or an aspiring game creator, this guide will empower you to unleash your creativity and bring your unique game ideas to life within the aos environment. Setting up the Development Environment Start by creating a new file named ao-effect.lua in your preferred directory. NOTE Ideally, this file should be placed in the same directory where your game process runs to ease the loading of the code. Else, you'll need to use relative paths to access the file. Writing the Code Now, let's dive into the logic. You'll notice that your game logic will involve calling functions and variables defined in the arena's logic. This showcases the power of composability, where your game builds on top of the existing arena logic, allowing seamless integration of variables and functions between the two. Because both logic become part of a unified logic for the game process. Intializing Game Mechanics First, define essential variables and functions that set the stage for your game's mechanics: lua -- AO EFFECT: Game Mechanics for AO Arena Game -- Game grid dimensions Width = 40 -- Width of the grid Height = 40 -- Height of the grid Range = 1 -- The distance for blast effect -- Player energy settings MaxEnergy = 100 -- Maximum energy a player can have EnergyPerSec = 1 -- Energy gained per second -- Attack settings AverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill = 3 -- Average number of hits to eliminate a player -- Initializes default player state -- @ return Table representing player's initial state function playerInitState () return { x = math.random (Width / 8 ), y = math.random (Height / 8 ), health = 100 , energy = 0 } end -- Function to incrementally increase player's energy -- Called periodically to update player energy function onTick () if GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then return end -- Only active during \"Playing\" state if LastTick == undefined then LastTick = Now end local Elapsed = Now - LastTick if Elapsed >= 1000 then -- Actions performed every second for player, state in pairs (Players) do local newEnergy = math.floor ( math.min (MaxEnergy, state. energy + (Elapsed * EnergyPerSec // 2000 ))) state. energy = newEnergy end LastTick = Now end end This code initializes your game's mechanics, including grid dimensions, player energy, and attack settings. The playerInitState function sets up the initial state for players when the game begins. Player Movement Next, add the code for player movement: lua -- Handles player movement -- @ param msg: Message request sent by player with movement direction and player info function move (msg) local playerToMove = msg. From local direction = msg. Tags . Direction local directionMap = { Up = {x = 0 , y = - 1 }, Down = {x = 0 , y = 1 }, Left = {x = - 1 , y = 0 }, Right = {x = 1 , y = 0 }, UpRight = {x = 1 , y = - 1 }, UpLeft = {x = - 1 , y = - 1 }, DownRight = {x = 1 , y = 1 }, DownLeft = {x = - 1 , y = 1 } } -- calculate and update new coordinates if directionMap[direction] then local newX = Players[playerToMove]. x + directionMap[direction]. x local newY = Players[playerToMove]. y + directionMap[direction]. y -- updates player coordinates while checking for grid boundaries Players[playerToMove]. x = (newX - 1 ) % Width + 1 Players[playerToMove]. y = (newY - 1 ) % Height + 1 announce ( \"Player-Moved\" , playerToMove .. \" moved to \" .. Players[playerToMove]. x .. \",\" .. Players[playerToMove]. y .. \".\" ) else ao. send ({Target = playerToMove, Action = \"Move-Failed\" , Reason = \"Invalid direction.\" }) end onTick () -- Optional: Update energy each move end The move function calculates new player coordinates based on the chosen direction while ensuring that players remain within the grid boundaries. Player movement adds dynamic interaction to your game and is announced to all players and listeners. Player Attacks Then you must implement the logic for player attacks: lua -- Handles player attacks -- @ param msg: Message request sent by player with attack info and player state function attack (msg) local player = msg. From local attackEnergy = tonumber (msg. Tags . AttackEnergy ) -- get player coordinates local x = Players[player]. x local y = Players[player]. y -- check if player has enough energy to attack if Players[player]. energy < attackEnergy then ao. send ({Target = player, Action = \"Attack-Failed\" , Reason = \"Not enough energy.\" }) return end -- update player energy and calculate damage Players[player]. energy = Players[player]. energy - attackEnergy local damage = math.floor (( math.random () * 2 * attackEnergy) * ( 1 / AverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill)) announce ( \"Attack\" , player .. \" has launched a \" .. damage .. \" damage attack from \" .. x .. \",\" .. y .. \"!\" ) -- check if any player is within range and update their status for target, state in pairs (Players) do if target ~= player and inRange (x, y, state. x , state. y , Range) then local newHealth = state. health - damage if newHealth <= 0 then eliminatePlayer (target, player) else Players[target]. health = newHealth ao. send ({Target = target, Action = \"Hit\" , Damage = tostring (damage), Health = tostring (newHealth)}) ao. send ({Target = player, Action = \"Successful-Hit\" , Recipient = target, Damage = tostring (damage), Health = tostring (newHealth)}) end end end end -- Helper function to check if a target is within range -- @ param x1, y1: Coordinates of the attacker -- @ param x2, y2: Coordinates of the potential target -- @ param range: Attack range -- @ return Boolean indicating if the target is within range function inRange (x1, y1, x2, y2, range) return x2 >= (x1 - range) and x2 <= (x1 + range) and y2 >= (y1 - range) and y2 <= (y1 + range) end The attack function calculates damage based on attack energy, checks player energy, and updates player health accordingly. Player attacks add the competitive element in your game, allowing players to engage with each other. The attacks are also announced to the players and listeners for real-time updates of the game. Handling the Logic Lastly, you must setup handlers: lua -- HANDLERS: Game state management for AO-Effect -- Handler for player movement handlers.add ( \"PlayerMove\" , { Action = \"PlayerMove\" }, move) -- Handler for player attacks handlers.add ( \"PlayerAttack\" , { Action = \"PlayerAttack\" }, attack) As seen in earlier guides, the handlers help trigger functions when their respective patterns are met. You can refer to the final code for ao-effect.lua in the dropdown below: Final ao-effect.lua file lua -- AO EFFECT: Game Mechanics for AO Arena Game -- Game grid dimensions Width = 40 -- Width of the grid Height = 40 -- Height of the grid Range = 1 -- The distance for blast effect -- Player energy settings MaxEnergy = 100 -- Maximum energy a player can have EnergyPerSec = 1 -- Energy gained per second -- Attack settings AverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill = 3 -- Average number of hits to eliminate a player -- Initializes default player state -- @ return Table representing player's initial state function playerInitState () return { x = math.random ( 0 , Width), y = math.random ( 0 , Height), health = 100 , energy = 0 } end -- Function to incrementally increase player's energy -- Called periodically to update player energy function onTick () if GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then return end -- Only active during \"Playing\" state if LastTick == undefined then LastTick = Now end local Elapsed = Now - LastTick if Elapsed >= 1000 then -- Actions performed every second for player, state in pairs (Players) do local newEnergy = math.floor ( math.min (MaxEnergy, state. energy + (Elapsed * EnergyPerSec // 2000 ))) state. energy = newEnergy end LastTick = Now end end -- Handles player movement -- @ param msg: Message request sent by player with movement direction and player info function move (msg) local playerToMove = msg. From local direction = msg. Tags .

From local attackEnergy = tonumber (msg. Tags . AttackEnergy ) -- get player coordinates local x = Players[player]. x local y = Players[player]. y -- check if player has enough energy to attack if Players[player]. energy < attackEnergy then ao. send ({Target = player, Action = \"Attack-Failed\" , Reason = \"Not enough energy.\" }) return end -- update player energy and calculate damage Players[player]. energy = Players[player]. energy - attackEnergy local damage = math.floor (( math.random () * 2 * attackEnergy) * ( 1 / AverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill)) announce ( \"Attack\" , player .. \" has launched a \" .. damage .. \" damage attack from \" .. x .. \",\" .. y .. \"!\" ) -- check if any player is within range and update their status for target, state in pairs (Players) do if target ~= player and inRange (x, y, state. x , state. y , Range) then local newHealth = state. health - damage if newHealth <= 0 then eliminatePlayer (target, player) else Players[target]. health = newHealth ao. send ({Target = target, Action = \"Hit\" , Damage = tostring (damage), Health = tostring (newHealth)}) ao. send ({Target = player, Action = \"Successful-Hit\" , Recipient = target, Damage = tostring (damage), Health = tostring (newHealth)}) end end end end -- Helper function to check if a target is within range -- @ param x1, y1: Coordinates of the attacker -- @ param x2, y2: Coordinates of the potential target -- @ param range: Attack range -- @ return Boolean indicating if the target is within range function inRange (x1, y1, x2, y2, range) return x2 >= (x1 - range) and x2 <= (x1 + range) and y2 >= (y1 - range) and y2 <= (y1 + range) end -- HANDLERS: Game state management for AO-Effect -- Handler for player movement handlers.add ( \"PlayerMove\" , { Action = \"PlayerMove\" }, move) -- Handler for player attacks handlers.add ( \"PlayerAttack\" , { Action = \"PlayerAttack\" }, attack) Loading and Testing Once you've written your game code, it's time to load it into the aos game process and test your game: lua . load ao - effect. lua IMPORTANT Make sure to load the arena blueprint in the same process as well. Invite friends or create test player processes to experience your game and make any necessary adjustments for optimal performance. What's Next Congratulations!

With aos you can interact with processes and you can code processes in a very simple and intuitive way. All you need is a terminal and an editor. The language chosen for aos is lua , which is a robust and deterministic dynamic language that is a lot of fun to work with. If you haven't done so yet, take 15 minutes and go through our tutorials .

You can use aos as your personal operating system, your development environment for building ao Processes, and your bot Army. Lets go over some basic commands. Variables If you want to display the contents of any variable through the console, simply type the variable name. lua Name Inbox the Inbox is a collection of messages that your Process has received. lua Inbox[ 1 ] If you want to get a count of messages, just add the # infront of Inbox . lua # Inbox The process of checking how many messages are in the inbox is a very common pattern. To make this easier, you can create a function that returns the number of messages within the inbox and displays it in the prompt. Use either .editor or .load file to load this function on your process. lua function Prompt () return \"Inbox: \" .. # Inbox .. \" > \" end The Expected Results: lua undefined Inbox : 2 > Your prompt now has changed to include the number of messages in your inbox. Globals In aos process there are some Globals that can make development a little more intuitive. Name Description Type Inbox This is a lua Table that stores all the messages that are received and not handlers by any handlers. Table(Array) Send(Message) This is a global function that is available in the interactive environment that allows you to send messages to Processes function Spawn(Module, Message) This is a global function that is available in the aos interactive environment that allows you to spawn processes Name a string that is set on init that describes the name of your process string Owner a string that is set on the init of the process that documents the owner of the process, warning if you change this value, it can brick you ability to interact with your process string Handlers a lua Table that contains helper functions that allows you to create handlers that execute functionality based on the pattern matching function on inbound messages table Dump a function that takes any lua Table and generates a print friendly output of the data function Utils a functional utility library with functions like map, reduce, filter module ao this is a core function library for sending messages and spawing processes module Modules In aos there are some built in common lua modules that are already available for you to work with, these modules can be referenced with a \"require\" function. Name Description json a json module that allows you to encode and decode json documents ao contains ao specific functions like send and spawn .base64 a base64 module that allows you to encode and decode base64 text .pretty a pretty print module using the function tprint to output formatted syntax .utils an utility function library Pager Previous page aos (Compute) Next page Installing \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/installing.html\nInstalling aos Installing aos only requires NodeJS - https://nodejs.org NOTE: If you are on windows you may get better results with WSL Console. sh npm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io Once installed you can run by typing aos Pager Previous page Introduction Next page CLI \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/cli.html\nCLI There are some command-line arguments you pass to our aos to do the following: [name] - create a new process or loads an existing process for your wallet --load [file] - load a file, you can add one or many of this command --cron [interval] - only used when creating a process --wallet [walletfile] - use a specific wallet Managing multiple processes with aos sh aos Starts or connects to a process with the name default sh aos chatroom Starts or connects to a process with the name of chatroom sh aos treasureRoom Starts or connects to a process with the name of treasureRoom Load flag sh aos treasureRoom --load greeting.lua --load treasure.lua --load puzzle.lua With the load flag I can load many source files to my process CRON Flag If you want to setup your process to react on a schedule we need to tell ao, we do that when we spawn the process. sh aos chatroom --cron 2-minutes Tag flags With the tag flags, you can start a process with some custom tags (for e.g. using them as static environment variables): sh aos chatroom --tag-name Chat-Theme --tag-value Dark --tag-name Chat-Name --tag-value Mychat The command above will add the extra tags to the transaction that spawns your process: ts // process data item tags [ ... { name: \"Chat-Theme\" , value: \"Dark\" }, { name: \"Chat-Name\" , value: \"Mychat\" } ... ] Pager Previous page Installing Next page Prompt Customization \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/prompt.html\nCustomizing the Prompt in aos Step 1: Open aos and Start the Editor Launch the aos command-line interface. Enter .editor to open the inline text editor. Step 2: Write the Custom Prompt Function In the editor, define your custom prompt function. For example: lua function Prompt () return \"YourName@aos> \" end Customize \"YourName@aos> \" to your preferred prompt text. Step 3: Exit and Run Your Code To exit the editor and execute your code, type .done and then press Enter. Your aos prompt should now display the new custom format. Step 4: Save for Future Use (Optional) If you wish to use this prompt in future aos sessions, save your script in a Lua file. In subsequent sessions, load this script to apply your custom prompt. Maximizing Your Prompt There's a great deal of utility and creativity that can come from customizing your prompt. Several things you can do within your prompt are: Tracking the number of unhandled messages you have in your inbox by creating a function that shows how many messages you have. lua --Example: function Prompt () return \"YourName Inbox: [\" .. # Inbox .. \"] > \" end Tracking the number of members are within your process ID's chatroom. Tracking the balance of a specified token that your process ID holds. Conclusion Now that you understand how to maximize the utility within your Prompt, you've now gained a crucial step to streamlining your ao development experience. Pager Previous page CLI Next page A Ping-Pong Server \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/pingpong.html\nCreating a Pingpong Process in aos This tutorial will guide you through creating a simple \"ping-pong\" process in aos. In this process, whenever it receives a message with the data \"ping\", it will automatically reply with \"pong\". This is a basic example of message handling and interaction between processes in aos. Step 1: Open the aos CLI Start by opening your command-line interface and typing aos to enter the aos environment. Step 2: Access the Editor Type .editor in the aos CLI to open the inline text editor. This is where you'll write your ping-pong handler code. Step 3: Write the Pingpong Handler In the editor, enter the following Lua code to add a handler for the pingpong pattern: lua handlers.add ( \"pingpong\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingData ( \"ping\" ), Handlers. utils . reply ( \"pong\" ) ) This lua script does three things: It adds a new handler named \"pingpong\". It uses Handlers.utils.hasMatchingData(\"ping\") to check if incoming messages contain the data \"ping\". If the message contains \"ping\", Handlers.utils.reply(\"pong\") automatically sends back a message with the data \"pong\". Step 4: Exit the Editor After writing your code, type .done and press Enter to exit the editor and run the script. Step 5: Test the Pingpong Process To test the process, send a message with the data \"ping\" to the process. You can do this by typing the following command in the aos CLI: lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Data = \"ping\" }) The process should respond with a message containing \"pong\" in the Inbox . Step 6: Monitor the Inbox Check your Inbox to see the \"ping\" message and your Outbox to confirm the \"pong\" reply. lua Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data Step 7: Experiment and Observe Experiment by sending different messages and observe how only the \"ping\" messages trigger the \"pong\" response. Step 8: Save Your Process (Optional) If you want to use this process in the future, save the handler code in a Lua file for easy loading into aos sessions. INFO ADDITIONAL TIP: Handler Efficiency : The simplicity of the handler function is key. Ensure that it's efficient and only triggers under the correct conditions. Conclusion Congratulations! You have now created a basic ping-pong process in aos. This tutorial provides a foundation for understanding message handling and process interaction within the aos environment. As you become more comfortable with these concepts, you can expand to more complex processes and interactions, exploring the full potential of aos.

Pager Previous page A Ping-Pong Server Next page Understanding the Inbox \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aos/inbox-and-handlers.html\nUnderstanding the Inbox In aos, processes are executed in response to messages via handlers. Unhandled messages are routed to the process's Inbox. What are Handlers? A handler is a function that receives and evaluates messages within your process. It acts upon messages by taking them as parameters. lua function main (Message, ao) ... dostuff return { Output = ... , Messages = {}, Spawns = {} } end And the main function returns a lua Table providing Output, Messages, and Spawns or an Error . With aos you can add functionality to your process by using a Handler. The Handler takes three parameters: Name of the Handler Matcher function Handle function lua handlers.add ( \"name\" , function (Msg) -- Does this message match (return true or false) return Msg. Action == \"Register\" end , function (Msg) print ( \"Registered User.\" ) table.insert (Members, Msg. From ) ao. send ({Target = Msg. From , Data = \"Registered.\" }) end ) What about Inboxes? An inbox is a storage area for messages that have not yet been processed. Think of it as a holding zone for incoming, or \"inbound,\" items awaiting handling. Once a message is processed, it's no longer considered \"inbound\" and thus leaves the inbox. Example: Consider the inbox like your voicemail. Just as an unanswered phone call is directed to voicemail for you to address later, messages that your Process doesn't immediately handle are sent to the inbox. This way, unhandled messages are stored until you're ready to process them. Summary Initially, it might seem like all messages are meant to land in your Inbox, which can be puzzling if they disappear after being handled. The analogy of a voicemail should clarify this: much like calls you answer don't go to voicemail, messages you handle won't appear in your Inbox. This illustrates the roles of both the Inbox and Handlers.

If you wish to transfer ownership or lock the process so that no one can own, you simply modify the Owner variable to another wallet address or set it to nil . JSON encoding data as json When sending data to another process or an external service, you may want to use JSON as a way to encode the data for recipients. Using the json module in lua, you can encode and decode pure lua tables that contain values. lua Send ({Target = Router, Data = require ( 'json' ). encode ({hello = \"world\" })}) Send vs ao.send When to use Send vs ao.send Both functions send a message to a process, the difference is ao.send returns the message, in case you want to log it or troubleshoot. The Send function is intended to be used in the console for easier access. It is preferred to use ao.send in the handlers . But they are both interchangable in aos .

Two Ways to Create Tokens: 1 - Use the token blueprint: .load-blueprint token Using the token blueprint will create a token with all the handlers and state already defined. This is the easiest way to create a token. You'll be able to customize those handlers and state to your after loading the blueprint. You can learn more about available blueprints here: Blueprints INFO Using the token blueprint will definitely get quickly, but you'll still want to understand how to load and test the token, so you can customize it to your needs. 2 - Build from Scratch: The following guide will guide you through the process of creating a token from scratch. This is a more advanced way to create a token, but it will give you a better understanding of how tokens work. Preparations Step 1: Initializing the Token Open our preferred text editor, preferrably from within the same folder you used during the previous tutorial. Create a new file named token.lua . Within token.lua , you'll begin by initializing the token's state, defining its balance, name, ticker, and more: lua local json = require ( 'json' ) if not Balances then Balances = { [ao. id ] = 100000000000000 } end if Name ~= 'My Coin' then Name = 'My Coin' end if Ticker ~= 'COIN' then Ticker = 'COIN' end if Denomination ~= 10 then Denomination = 10 end if not Logo then Logo = 'optional arweave TXID of logo image' end Let's break down what we've done here: local json = require('json') : This first line of this code imports a module for later use. if not Balances then Balances = { [ao.id] = 100000000000000 } end : This second line is initializing a Balances table which is the way the Process tracks who posses the token. We initialize our token process ao.id to start with all the balance. The Next 4 Lines, if Name , if Ticker , if Denomination , and if not Logo are all optional, except for if Denomination , and are used to define the token's name, ticker, denomination, and logo respectively. INFO The code if Denomination ~= 10 then Denomination = 10 end tells us the number of the token that should be treated as a single unit. Step 2: Info and Balances Handlers Incoming Message Handler Now lets add our first Handler to handle incoming Messages. lua handlers.add ( 'info' , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( 'Action' , 'Info' ), function (msg) ao. send ( { Target = msg. From , Tags = { Name = Name, Ticker = Ticker, Logo = Logo, Denomination = tostring (Denomination) } }) end ) INFO At this point, you've probably noticed that we're building all of the handlers inside the token.lua file rather than using . editor . With many handlers and processes, it's perfectly fine to create your handlers using .editor , but because we're creating a full process for initizialing a token, setting up info and balances handlers, transfer handlers, and a minting handler, it's best to keep everything in one file. This also allows us to maintain consistency since each handler will be updated every time we reload the token.lua file into aos . This code means that if someone Sends a message with the Tag, Action = \"info\", our token will Send back a message with all of the information defined above. Note the Target = msg.From, this tells ao we are replying to the process that sent us this message. Info & Token Balance Handlers Now we can add 2 Handlers which provide information about token Balances. lua handlers.add ( 'balance' , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( 'Action' , 'Balance' ), function (msg) local bal = '0' -- If not Target is provided, then return the Senders balance if (msg. Tags . Target and Balances[msg. Tags . Target ]) then bal = tostring (Balances[msg. Tags . Target ]) elseif Balances[msg. From ] then bal = tostring (Balances[msg. From ]) end ao. send ({ Target = msg. From , Tags = { Target = msg. From , Balance = bal, Ticker = Ticker, Data = json. encode ( tonumber (bal)) } }) end ) handlers.add ( 'balances' , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( 'Action' , 'Balances' ), function (msg) ao. send ({ Target = msg. From , Data = json. encode (Balances) }) end ) The first Handler above Handlers.add('balance' handles a process or person requesting their own balance or the balance of a Target. Then replies with a message containing the info. The second Handler Handlers.add('balances' just replies with the entire Balances table. Step 3: Transfer Handlers Before we begin testing we will add 2 more Handlers one which allows for the transfer of tokens between processes or users. lua handlers.add ( 'transfer' , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( 'Action' , 'Transfer' ), function (msg) assert ( type (msg. Tags . Recipient ) == 'string' , 'Recipient is required!' ) assert ( type (msg. Tags . Quantity ) == 'string' , 'Quantity is required!' ) if not Balances[msg. From ] then Balances[msg. From ] = 0 end if not Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] then Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] = 0 end local qty = tonumber (msg. Tags . Quantity ) assert ( type (qty) == 'number' , 'qty must be number' ) if Balances[msg. From ] >= qty then Balances[msg. From ] = Balances[msg. From ] - qty Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] = Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] + qty --[[ Only Send the notifications to the Sender and Recipient if the Cast tag is not set on the Transfer message ]] -- if not msg. Tags . Cast then -- Debit-Notice message template, that is sent to the Sender of the transfer local debitNotice = { Target = msg. From , Action = 'Debit-Notice' , Recipient = msg. Recipient , Quantity = tostring (qty), Data = Colors. gray .. \"You transferred \" .. Colors. blue .. msg. Quantity .. Colors. gray .. \" to \" .. Colors. green .. msg. Recipient .. Colors. reset } -- Credit-Notice message template, that is sent to the Recipient of the transfer local creditNotice = { Target = msg. Recipient , Action = 'Credit-Notice' , Sender = msg. From , Quantity = tostring (qty), Data = Colors. gray .. \"You received \" .. Colors. blue .. msg. Quantity .. Colors. gray .. \" from \" .. Colors. green .. msg. From .. Colors. reset } -- Add forwarded tags to the credit and debit notice messages for tagName, tagValue in pairs (msg) do -- Tags beginning with \"X-\" are forwarded if string.sub (tagName, 1 , 2 ) == \"X-\" then debitNotice[tagName] = tagValue creditNotice[tagName] = tagValue end end -- Send Debit-Notice and Credit-Notice ao. send (debitNotice) ao. send (creditNotice) end else ao. send ({ Target = msg. Tags . From , Tags = { Action = 'Transfer-Error' , [ 'Message-Id' ] = msg. Id , Error = 'Insufficient Balance!' } }) end end ) In summary, this code checks to make sure the Recipient and Quantity Tags have been provided, initializes the balances of the person sending the message and the Recipient if they dont exist and then attempts to transfer the specified quantity to the Recipient in the Balances table. lua Balances[msg. From ] = Balances[msg. From ] - qty Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] = Balances[msg. Tags . Recipient ] + qty If the transfer was successful a Debit-Notice is sent to the sender of the original message and a Credit-Notice is sent to the Recipient. lua -- Send Debit-Notice to the Sender ao. send ({ Target = msg. From , Tags = { Action = 'Debit-Notice' , Recipient = msg. Tags . Recipient , Quantity = tostring (qty) } }) -- Send Credit-Notice to the Recipient ao. send ({ Target = msg. Tags . Recipient , Tags = { Action = 'Credit-Notice' , Sender = msg. From , Quantity = tostring (qty) } }) If there was insufficient balance for the transfer it sends back a failure message lua ao. send ({ Target = msg. Tags . From , Tags = { Action = 'Transfer-Error' , [ 'Message-Id' ] = msg. Id , Error = 'Insufficient Balance!' } }) The line if not msg.Tags.Cast then Means were not producing any messages to push if the Cast tag was set. This is part of the ao protocol. Step 4: Mint Handler Finally, we will add a Handler to allow the minting of new tokens. lua handlers.add ( 'mint' , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( 'Action' , 'Mint' ), function (msg, env) assert ( type (msg. Tags . Quantity ) == 'string' , 'Quantity is required!' ) if msg. From == env. Process . Id then -- Add tokens to the token pool, according to Quantity local qty = tonumber (msg. Tags . Quantity ) Balances[env. Process . Id ] = Balances[env. Process . Id ] + qty else ao. send ({ Target = msg. Tags . From , Tags = { Action = 'Mint-Error' , [ 'Message-Id' ] = msg. Id , Error = 'Only the Process Owner can mint new ' .. Ticker .. ' tokens!' } }) end end ) This code checks to make sure the Quantity Tag has been provided and then adds the specified quantity to the Balances table. Loading and Testing Once you've created your token.lua file, or you've used .load-blueprint token , you're now ready to begin testing. 1 - Start the aos process Make sure you've started your aos process by running aos in your terminal. 2 - Loading the token.lua file If you've followd along with the guide, you'll have a token.lua file in the same directory as your aos process. From the aos prompt, load in the file. lua . load token. lua 3 - Testing the Token Now we can send Messages to our aos process id, from the same aos prompt to see if is working. If we use ao.id as the Target we are sending a message to ourselves. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Action = \"Info\" }) This should print the Info defined in the contract. Check the latest inbox message for the response. lua Inbox[ # Inbox]. Tags This should print the Info defined in the contract. INFO Make sure you numerically are checking the last message. To do so, run #Inbox first to see the total number of messages are in the inbox. Then, run the last message number to see the data. Example: If #Inbox returns 5 , then run Inbox[5].Data to see the data. 4 - Transfer Now, try to transfer a balance of tokens to another wallet or process id. INFO If you need another process id, you can run aos [name] in another terminal window to get a new process id. Make sure it's not the same aos [name] as the one you're currently using. Example: If you're using aos in one terminal window, you can run aos test in another terminal window to get a new process id. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Tags = { Action = \"Transfer\" , Recipient = 'another wallet or processid' , Quantity = '10000' }}) After sending, you'll receive a printed message in the terminal similar to Debit-Notice on the sender's side and Credit-Notice on the recipient's side. 5 - Check the Balances Now that you've transferred some tokens, let's check the balances. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Tags = { Action = \"Balances\" }}) lua Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data You will see two process IDs or wallet addresses, each displaying a balance. The first should be your sending process ID, the second should be the recipient's process ID. 6 - Minting Tokens Finally, attempt to mint some tokens. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Tags = { Action = \"Mint\" , Quantity = '1000' }}) And check the balances again. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Tags = { Action = \"Balances\" }}) Inbox[ # Inbox]. Data You'll then see the balance of the process ID that minted the tokens has increased. Conclusion That concludes the \"Build a Token\" guide. Learning out to build custom tokens will unlock a great deal of potential for your projects; whether that be creating a new currency, a token for a game, a governance token, or anything else you can imagine.

Unpacking the CRED Utils Blueprint The CRED Metatable CRED.balance : Evaluating CRED.balance will print your process's last known balance of your CRED. If you have never fetched your CRED balance before, it will be fetched automatically. If you think your CRED has recently changed, consider running CRED.update first. CRED.process : Evaluating CRED.process will print the process id of the CRED token issuer. CRED.send : Invoking CRED.send(targetProcessId, amount) like a function will transfer CRED from your ao process to another ao process. targetProcessId : string : the 43-character process id of the recipient. amount : integer : The quantity of CRED units to send. 1 CRED === 1000 CRED units. CRED.update : Evaluating CRED.update will fetch your latest CRED balance by sending a message to the CRED issuer process. The UpdateCredBalance handler (see below) will ingest the response message. Handler Definitions Credit Handler : The CRED_Credit handler allows the CRED issuer process (and aos ) to automatically notify you when your CRED balance increase. Debit Handler : The CRED_Debit handler allows the CRED issuer process (and aos ) to automatically notify you when your CRED balance decreases.

Installing npm sh npm install --save @permaweb/aoconnect yarn sh yarn add @permaweb/aoconnect -D This module can now be used from NodeJS as well as a browser, it can be included as shown below. ESM (Node & Browser) aka type: module js import { result, results, message, spawn, monitor, unmonitor, dryrun, } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; CJS (Node) type: commonjs js const { result , results , message , spawn , monitor , unmonitor , dryrun , } = require ( \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ); Pager Previous page Connect (js/lib) Next page Connecting to nodes \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/connecting.html\nConnecting to specific ao nodes When including ao connect in your code you have the ability to connect to a specific MU and CU, as well as being able to specifiy an Arweave gateway. This can be done by importing the \"connect\" function and extracting the functions from a call to the \"connect\" function. You may want to do this if you want to know which MU is being called when you send your message so that later you can debug from the specified MU. You also may want to read a result from a specific CU. You may in fact just prefer a particular MU and CU for a different reason. You can specify the gateway in order to use something other than the default, which is arweave.net. Importing without a call to connect js // Here aoconnect will implicitly use the default nodes/units import { result, results, message, spawn, monitor, unmonitor, dryrun, } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; Connecting to a specific MU, CU, and gateway js import { connect } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const { result , results , message , spawn , monitor , unmonitor , dryrun } = connect ( { MU_URL: \"https://mu.ao-testnet.xyz\" , CU_URL: \"https://cu.ao-testnet.xyz\" , GATEWAY_URL: \"https://arweave.net\" , }, ); // now spawn, message, and result can be used the same way as if they were imported directly All three of these parameters to connect are optional and it is valid to specify only 1 or 2 of them, or none. You could pass in just the MU_URL, for example. js import { connect } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const { result , results , message , spawn , monitor , unmonitor , dryrun } = connect ( { MU_URL: \"https://ao-mu-1.onrender.com\" , }, ); Pager Previous page Installing aoconnect Next page Sending Messages \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/sending-messages.html\nSending a Message to a Process A deep dive into the concept of Messages can be found in the ao Messages concept. This guide focuses on using ao connect to send a message to a process. Sending a message is the central way in which your app can interact with ao. A message is input to a process. There are 5 parts of a message that you can specify which are \"target\", \"data\", \"tags\", \"anchor\", and finally the messages \"signature\". Refer to your process module's source code or documentation to see how the message is used in its computation. The ao connect library will translate the parameters you pass it in the code below, construct a message, and send it. 🎓 To Learn more about Wallets visit the Permaweb Cookbook Sending a Message in NodeJS Need a test wallet, use npx -y @permaweb/wallet > /path/to/wallet.json to create a wallet keyfile. js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { message, createDataItemSigner } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const wallet = JSON . parse ( readFileSync ( \"/path/to/arweave/wallet.json\" ). toString (), ); // The only 2 mandatory parameters here are process and signer await message ({ /* The arweave TXID of the process, this will become the \"target\".

Results are JSON objects consisting of the following fields: messages, spawns, output and error. Results are what the ao system uses to send messages and spawns that are generated by processes. A process can send a message just like you can as a developer, by returning messages and spawns in a result. You may want to access a result to display the output generated by your message. Or you may want to see what messages etc., were generated. You do not need to take the messages and spawns from a result and send them yourself. They are automatically handled by Messenger Units (MU's). A call to results can also provide you paginated list of multiple results. Fetching a single result js import { result } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; let { Messages, Spawns, Output, Error } = await result ({ // the arweave TXID of the message message: \"message-id\" , // the arweave TXID of the process process: \"process-id\" , }); Fetching a set of results js import { results } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; // fetching the first page of results let resultsOut = await results ({ process: \"process-id\" , sort: \"ASC\" , limit: 25 , }); // calling more with a cursor let resultsOut2 = await results ({ process: \"process-id\" , from: resultsOut.edges?.[resultsOut.edges. length - 1 ]?.cursor ?? null , sort: \"ASC\" , limit: 25 , }); Pager Previous page Sending Messages Next page Spawning Processes \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/spawning-processes.html\nSpawning a Process A deep dive into the concept of Processes can be found in the ao Processes concept. This guide focuses on using ao connect to spawn a Process. In order to spawn a Process you must have the TXID of an ao Module that has been uploaded to Arweave. The Module is the source code for the Process. The Process itself is an instantiation of that source. You must also have the wallet address of a Scheduler Unit (SU). This specified SU will act as the scheduler for this Process. This means that all nodes in the system can tell that they need to read and write to this SU for this Process. You can use the address below. Wallet address of an available Scheduler lua _GQ33BkPtZrqxA84vM8Zk - N2aO0toNNu_C - l - rawrBA In addition, in order to receive messages from other processes an Authority tag must be supplied with the wallet address of an authorised Messaging Unit (MU).

For example, a balance of a token, or a result of a transfer, etc. You can use DryRun to obtain an output without sending an actual message. js import { createDataItemSigner, dryrun } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const result = await dryrun ({ process: 'PROCESSID' , data: '' , tags: [{name: 'Action' , value: 'Balance' }, anchor: '1234' , ... rest are optional (Id, Owner, etc) }); console. log (result.Messages[ 0 ]); Pager Previous page Spawning Processes Next page Monitoring Cron \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/monitoring-cron.html\nMonitoring Cron When using cron messages, ao users need a way to start injesting the messages, using this monitor method, ao users can initiate the subscription service for cron messages. Setting cron tags means that your process will start producing cron results in its outbox, but you need to monitor these results if you want messages from those results to be pushed through the network. js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { createDataItemSigner, monitor } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const wallet = JSON . parse ( readFileSync ( \"/path/to/arweave/wallet.json\" ). toString (), ); const result = await monitor ({ process: \"process-id\" , signer: createDataItemSigner (wallet), }); You can stop monitoring by calling unmonitor js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { createDataItemSigner, unmonitor } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; const wallet = JSON . parse ( readFileSync ( \"/path/to/arweave/wallet.json\" ). toString (), ); const result = await unmonitor ({ process: \"process-id\" , signer: createDataItemSigner (wallet), }); Pager Previous page Calling DryRun Next page Assign Data \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/guides/aoconnect/assign-data.html\nSending an Assignment to a Process Assignments can be used to load Data from another Message into a Process. Or to not duplicate Messages. You can create one Message and then assign it to any number of processes. This will make it available to the Processes you have sent an Assignment to. Sending an Assignment in NodeJS js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { assign } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; await assign ({ process: \"process-id\" , message: \"message-id\" , }) . then (console.log) . catch (console.error); Excluding DataItem fields You can also exclude most DataItem fields which will tell the CU not to load them into your process. You may want to do this if you need only the header data like the Tags and not the Data itself etc... If you exclude the Owner it wont have any effect because the CU requires the Owner, so excluding Owner will be ignored by the CU. Only capitalized DataItem/Message fields will have an effect in the CU. js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { assign } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; await assign ({ process: \"process-id\" , message: \"message-id\" , exclude: [ \"Data\" , \"Anchor\" ], }) . then (console.log) . catch (console.error); Assigning L1 Transactions You can also assign a layer 1 transaction by passing the baseLayer param into assign. This is useful for minting tokens etc... using the base layer. By default, if the L1 tx does not have at least 20 confirmations the SU will reject it. This can be changed by setting the Settlement-Depth tag to a different number on the Process when it is created. js import { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\" ; import { assign } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\" ; await assign ({ process: \"process-id\" , message: \"layer 1 tx id\" , baseLayer: true , }) . then (console.log) . catch (console.error); Pager Previous page Monitoring Cron Next page Concepts \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/index.html\nConcepts ao has a lot of concepts built into the design, but the core concepts are very simple principles: Two core types: Messages and Processes No shared state, only Holographic State Decentralized Computer (Grid) Below is a set of concept documents that break down the ao system into its distinct parts. Specifications Processes Messages Units How messaging works Pager Previous page First POST Request Next page Specifications \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/specs.html\nao Specs What is ao ? The ao computer is the actor oriented machine that emerges from the network of nodes that adhere to its core data protocol, running on the Arweave network. This document gives a brief introduction to the protocol and its functionality, as well as its technical details, such that builders can create new implementations and services that integrate with it. The ao computer is a single, unified computing environment (a Single System Image ), hosted on a heterogenous set of nodes in a distributed network. ao is designed to offer an environment in which an arbitrary number of parallel processes can be resident, coordinating through an open message passing layer. This message passing standard connects the machine's independently operating processes together into a 'web' -- in the same way that websites operate on independent servers but are conjoined into a cohesive, unified experience via hyperlinks. Learn More Pager Previous page Concepts Next page Messages \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/messages.html\nMessages The Message serves as the fundamental data protocol unit within ao, crafted from ANS-104 DataItems , thereby aligning with the native structure of Arweave. When engaged in a Process, a Message is structured as follows: lua { Cron = false , Data = \"Hello aos\" , Epoch = 0 , From = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" , Id = \"ayVo53qvZswpvxLlhMf8xmGjwxN0LGuHzzQpTLT0_do\" , Nonce = 1 , Owner = \"z1pq2WzmaYnfDwvEFgUZBj48anUsxxN64ZjbWOsIn08\" , Signature = \"...\" , Tags = { Type = \"Message\" , Variant = \"ao.TN.1\" , [ \"Data-Protocol\" ] = \"ao\" , [ \"From-Module\" ] = \"lXfdCypsU3BpYTWvupgTioLoZAEOZL2_Ihcqepz6RiQ\" , [ \"From-Process\" ] = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" }, Target = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" , Timestamp = 1704936415711 , [ \"Block-Height\" ] = 1340762 , [ \"Forwarded-By\" ] = \"z1pq2WzmaYnfDwvEFgUZBj48anUsxxN64ZjbWOsIn08\" , [ \"Hash-Chain\" ] = \"hJ0B-0yxKxeL3IIfaIIF7Yr6bFLG2vQayaF8G0EpjbY\" } This architecture merges the Assignment Type with the Message Type, granting the Process a comprehensive understanding of the Message's context for effective processing. When sending a message, here is a visual diagram of how the messages travels through the ao computer. The message workflow initiates with the MU (Messenger Unit), where the message's signature is authenticated. Following this, the SU (Scheduler Unit) allocates an Epoch and Nonce to the message, bundles the message with an Assignment Type, and dispatches it to Arweave. Subsequently, the aoconnect library retrieves the outcome from the CU (Compute Unit). The CU then calls for all preceding messages leading up to the current Message Id from the SU (Scheduler Unit), processes them to deduce the result. Upon completion, the computed result is conveyed back to aoconnect , which is integrated within client interfaces such as aos . Ethereum Signed Message If the Message ANS-104 DataItem was signed using Ethereum keys, then the value in the Owner and From fields will be the EIP-55 Ethereum address of the signer. For example: 0xfB6916095ca1df60bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359 . Summary Messages serve as the primary data protocol type for the ao network, leveraging ANS-104 Data-Items native to Arweave. Messages contain several fields including data content, origin, target, and cryptographic elements like signatures and nonces. They follow a journey starting at the Messenger Unit (MU), which ensures they are signed, through the Scheduler Unit (SU) that timestamps and sequences them, before being bundled and published to Arweave. The aoconnect library then reads the result from the Compute Unit (CU), which processes messages to calculate results and sends responses back through aoconnect , utilized by clients such as aos . The CU is the execution environment for these processes. Pager Previous page Specifications Next page Processes \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/processes.html\nProcesses Processes possess the capability to engage in communication via message passing, both receiving and dispatching messages within the network. Additionally, they hold the potential to instantiate further processes, enhancing the network's computational fabric. This dynamic method of data dissemination and interaction within the network is referred to as a 'holographic state', underpinning the shared and persistent state of the network. When building a Process with aos you have the ability to add handlers , these handlers can be added by calling the Handlers.add function, passing a \"name\", a \"match\" function, and a \"handle\" function. The core module contains a helper library that gets injected into the handler function, this library is called ao . lua { env = { Process = { Id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" , Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\" , Tags = { ... } }, Module = { Id = \"UAUszdznoUPQvXRbrFuIIH6J0N_LnJ1h4Trej28UgrE\" , Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\" , Tags = { .. } } }, id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" , isTrusted = \"function: 0x5468d0\" , result = \"function: 0x547120\" , send = \"function: 0x547618\" , spawn = \"function: 0x5468b0\" } The main functions to look at in this ao helper is ao.send(Message) - sends a message to a process ao.spawn(Module, Message) - creates a new process Ethereum Signed Process or Module For an ao Process or Module , if the ANS-104 DataItem was signed using Ethereum keys, then the value in the env.Process.Owner or env.Module.Owner field, respectively, will be the EIP-55 Ethereum address of the signer. For example: 0xfB6916095ca1df60bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359 ao.send Example lua ao. send ({ Target = Chatroom, Action = \"Broadcast\" , Data = \"Hello from my Process!\" }) ao.spawn Example lua ao. spawn (ao. env . Module . Id , { [ \"Memory-Limit\" ] = \"500-mb\" , [ \"Compute-Limit\" ] = \"900000000000000000\" }) ao.env NOTE: ao.env is important context data that you may need as a developer creating processes. The ao.env property contains the Process and Module Reference Objects lua env = { Process = { Id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\" , Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\" , Tags = { ... } }, Module = { Id = \"UAUszdznoUPQvXRbrFuIIH6J0N_LnJ1h4Trej28UgrE\" , Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\" , Tags = { .. } } } Both the Process and the Module contain the attributes of the ao Data-Protocol. Summary Processes in the network communicate through message passing and can create new processes, contributing to a 'holographic state' of shared and persistent data. Developers can build a Process using aos by adding handlers through the Handlers.add function with specific name, match, and handle functions. The ao helper library within the core module aids in this process, providing functions like ao.send to dispatch messages and ao.spawn to create new modules, as well as the important ao.env property which contains essential Process and Module information. The ao Data-Protocol outlines the structure and attributes of these elements. Pager Previous page Messages Next page Units \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/concepts/units.html\nUnits What is a Unit? The ao Computer is composed of three Unit types, each type contains a set of responsibilities for the computer. And each Unit is horizontally scalable. In ao we have the Messager Unit or MU , and the Scheduler Unit or SU , and the Compute Unit or the CU . These units are the building blocks of the ao Computer Grid. There can be 1 or more of these units on the network and they work together to power the ao Operating System or aos . Messager Unit - This unit is the front door to ao, it receives all the messages from the outside and as well as directs traffic flow for Processes. This traffic flow we call pushing . Each process can return an Outbox when it evaluates a Message, and this Outbox can be filled with Messages or requests to Spawn new processes, and the Messenger Unit is responsible for extracting these Messages from the Outbox and signing them and sending them to the Scheduler Units for processing. Scheduler Unit - The Scheduler unit is responsible for ordering the messages, and storing those messages on Arweave. It is important that every message is appropriately ordered so that the evaluation can be replayed and verified. The Scheduler Unit is responsible for this process. It provides the abilty to query it via an endpoint to get the order of messages for evaluation. Compute Unit - The Compute unit is responsible for compute, this unit loads the binary module and manages the memory of that module, so that the execution of the process is alway running on the most up to date memory. The compute unit provides the results of the evaluation back to the the messenger unit, which can then push any messages in the outbox of the given process. Summary The ao Computer consists of three scalable unit types—Messager Unit (MU), Scheduler Unit (SU), and Compute Unit (CU)—which form the foundation of the ao Computer. These units can exist in multiples on the network and collectively operate the ao Operating System (aos). The MU acts as the entry point, receiving external messages and managing process communications. It processes outgoing messages and spawn requests from process outboxes and forwards them to the SU. The SU ensures messages are properly sequenced and stored on Arweave, maintaining order for consistent replay and verification of message evaluations. The CU handles computation, loading binary modules, and managing memory to ensure processes run with current data. It then returns the evaluation results to the MU for further message handling.

Unix is a powerful operating system, but in its design it is focused on two Principal \"Types\". Files and Programs. A File is data and a program is logic, when you combine the two you get information. Input.file | TransformProgram | Output.file You may have done something like this on the command line without knowing what you are doing. Being able to connect files to programs and return files which can then be passed to other programs creates a complex system composed of simple applications. This is a very powerful idea. Now, lets talk about ao the hyper parallel computer, and lets change the idea of a File to the ao concept of a Message and the idea of a Program to the ao concept of a Process. The ao computer takes messages and sends them to Processes in which those Processes can output messages that can be sent to other Processes. The result is a complex system built on simple modular logic containers. MessageA | Process | MessageB Here is a description of the process as outlined in the flowchart: A message is initiated from an ao Connect. This message is sent to the mu service using a POST request. The body of the request contains data following a protocol, labeled 'ao', and is of the type 'Message'. The mu service processes the POST request and forwards the message to the su service. This is also done using a POST request with the same data protocol and message type. The su service stores the assignment and message on Arweave. A GET request is made to the cu service to retrieve result based on a message ID. The cu is a service that evaluates messages on processes and can return result based on an individual message identifier. A GET request is made to the su service to retrieve the assignment and message. This request is looking for messages from a process ID, within a range of time from a start (from the last evaluation point) to (to the current messageId). The final step is to push any outbox Messages. It involves reviewing the messages and spawns in the Result Object. Based on the outcome of this check, the steps 2, 3, and 4 may be repeated for each relevant message or spawn.

Before we can explore ao in greater depth, let's take a moment to learn the basics of Lua: your companion for commanding aos processes. Lua is a simple language with few surprises. If you know Javascript, it will feel like a simplified, purer version. If you are learning from-scratch, it will seem like a tiny language that focuses on the important stuff: Clean computation with sane syntax. In this section we will cover the basics of Lua in just a few minutes. If you already know Lua, jump right through to the next chapter Jumping back into your aos process. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be assuming that you have already completed the getting started guide. If not, complete that first. If you logged out of your process, you can always re-open it by running aos on your commandline, optionally specifying your key file with --wallet [location] . Basic Lua expressions. In the remainder of this primer we will quickly run through Lua's core features and syntax. Try out on the examples on your aos process as you go, or skip them if they are intuitive to you. Basic arithmetic : Try some basic arithmetic, like 5 + 3 . After processing, you will see the result 8 . + , - , * , / , and ^ all work as you might expect. % is the symbol that Lua uses for modulus. Setting variables : Type a = 10 and press enter. This sets the variable a to 10. By convention (not enforced by the language), global variables start with a capital letter in Lua (for example Handlers ). Using variables : Now type a * 2 . You will see 20 returned on the command line. String concatenation : Say hello to yourself by executing \"Hello, \" .. ao.id . Experimenting with conditional statements. If-Else : Like most programming languages, Lua uses if-else blocks to conditionally execute code. In your aos process, type .editor and press enter. This will open an in-line text editor within your command-line interface. lua aos_coolness = 9001 if aos_coolness > 9000 then return \"aos is coolness is over 9000!\" else return \"Oh. 🤷\" end Once you are finished editing on your terminal, type .done on a new line and press enter. This will terminate edit mode and submit the expression to your process for evaluation. As a result, you will see that aos is >9,000 cool. Good to know. if statements in Lua can also have additional elseif [condition] then blocks, making conditional execution hierarchies easier. Looping in Lua. There are a few different ways to loop in your code in Lua. Here are our favorites: While loops : Start by initalizing your counter to zero by typing n = 0 and pressing enter. Then open the inline editor again with .editor . lua while n < 5 do n = n + 1 end Type .done on a new line to execute the while loop. You can check the result of the loop by simply running n . For loops : Lua can also execute python-style for loops between a set of values. For example, use the .editor to enter the following code block: lua for m = 1 , 100 do n = n + m end Request the new value of the variable by running n again. Getting functional. Define a function : Using the .editor once again, submit the following lines: lua function greeting (name) return \"Hello, \" .. name end Once submitted, aos will return undefined , as function (and variable) definition in Lua doesn't return a value. Lua also has 'anonymous' or 'higher order' functions. These essentially allow you to use functions themselves as if they are normal data -- to be passed as arguments to other functions, etc. The following example defines an anonymous function and is equivalent to the above: lua greeting = function (name) return \"Hello, \" .. name end Calling the function : Call the function with greeting(\"Earthling\") . aos will return \"Hello, Earthling\" . Defining deep objects with tables. Tables are Lua's only compound data structure. They map keys to values , but can also be used like traditional arrays. Create a simple table : Type ao_is = {\"hyper\", \"parallel\", \"compute\"} to create a simple table. Accessing the table's elements : Access an element with ao_is[2] . aos will return parallel . Note: Indices in Lua start from 1! Count a table's elements : The size of a table in Lua is found with the operator # . For example, running #ao_is will return 3 . Set a named element : Type ao_is[\"cool\"] = true to add a new named key to the table. Named elements can also be accessed with the . operator, for example ao_is.cool . Lua Wats. aos uses Lua because it is a simple, clean language that most experienced programmers can learn very quickly, and is an increasingly popular first programming language, too, thanks to its use in video games like Roblox. Nonetheless, there are a few things about the language that are prone to trip up rookie Lua builders. Tastes may vary, but here is our exhaustive list of Lua wat s: Remember: Table indexing starts from 1 not 0! Remember: 'Not equals' is expressed with ~= , rather than != or similar. Remember: Objects in Lua are called 'tables', rather than their more common names. Let's go! With this in mind, you now know everything you need in order to build awesome decentralized processes with Lua! In the next chapter we will begin to build parallel processes with Lua and aos.

This tutorial will walk you through the key global functions and variables available in the aos environment, giving you a foundational understanding of how to interact with and utilize aos effectively. 1. Introduction to Inbox What It Is : Inbox is a Lua table that stores all messages received by your process but not yet handled. How to Use : Check Inbox to see incoming messages. Iterate through Inbox[x] to process these messages. 2. Sending Messages with Send(Message) Functionality : Send(Message) is a global function to send messages to other processes. Usage Example : Send({Target = \"...\", Data = \"Hello, Process!\"}) sends a message with the data \"Hello, Process!\" to a specified process. 3. Creating Processes with Spawn(Module, Message) Purpose : Use Spawn(Module, Message) to create new processes. Example : Spawn(\"MyModule\", {Data = \"Start\"}) starts a new process using \"MyModule\" with the provided message. 4. Understanding Name and Owner Name : A string set during initialization, representing the process's name. Owner : Indicates the owner of the process. Changing this might restrict your ability to interact with your process. Important Note : Treat these as read-only to avoid issues. 5. Utilizing Handlers What They Are : Handlers is a table of helper functions for creating message handlers. Usage : Define handlers in Handlers to specify actions for different incoming messages based on pattern matching. 6. Data Representation with Dump Function : Dump converts any Lua table into a print-friendly format. How to Use : Useful for debugging or viewing complex table structures. Example: Dump(Inbox) prints the contents of Inbox . 7. Leveraging Utils Module Contents : Utils contains a collection of functional utilities like map , reduce , and filter . Usage : Great for data manipulation and functional programming patterns in Lua. For example, Utils.map(myTable, function(x) return x * 2 end) to double the values in a table. 8. Exploring the ao Core Library Description : ao is a core module that includes key functions for message handling and process management. Key Features : Includes functions for sending messages ( send ) and spawning processes ( spawn ), along with environment variables. Conclusion This brief tour introduces you to the primary globals and functionalities within the aos environment. With these tools at your disposal, you can create and manage processes, handle messages, and utilize Lua's capabilities to build efficient and responsive applications on the aos platform. Experiment with these features to get a deeper understanding and to see how they can be integrated into your specific use cases. Happy coding in aos!

It enables deployment on the web for client and server applications, offering a high level of performance and efficiency. WebAssembly is designed to maintain the security and sandboxing features of web browsers, making it a suitable choice for web-based applications. It's a key technology for web developers, allowing them to write code in multiple languages and compile it into bytecode that runs in the browser at near-native speed. The significance of WebAssembly lies in its ability to bridge the gap between web and native applications. It allows complex applications and games, previously limited to desktop environments, to run in the browser with comparable performance. This opens up new possibilities for web development, including the creation of high-performance web apps, games, and even the porting of existing desktop applications to the web. WebAssembly operates alongside JavaScript, complementing it by enabling performance-critical components to be written in languages better suited for such tasks, thereby enhancing the capabilities and performance of web applications.

As a developer you have the option to leverage this library or not, but it integrated by default. Properties Name Description Type id Process Identifier (TXID) string _module Module Identifier (TXID) string authorities Set of Trusted TXs string Authority Identifiers that the process is able to accept transactions from that are not the owner or the process (0-n) string _version The version of the library string env Evaluation Environment string outbox Holds Messages and Spawns for response object Methods send(msg: Message<table>) : Message<table> The send function takes a Message object or partial message object, it adds additional ao specific tags to the object and returns a full Message object, as well as insert into the ao.outbox.Messages table. parameters msg Schema json { \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"Target\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"Process/Wallet to send message to\" }, \"Data\" : { \"type\" : \"any\" , \"description\" : \"data to send in message DataItem\" }, \"Tags\" : { \"type\" : \"object or array<name,value>\" \"description\" : \"This property can be an array of name,value objects or an object\" } } } Example 1 lua local message = ao. send ({ Target = msg.

An AO process responds based on receiving Messages, these messages are defined using the Arweave DataItem specification which consists of Tags, and Data. Using the Handlers library, you can define a pipeline of process evaluation based on the attributes of the AO Message. Each handler items consists of a pattern function, a handle function, and a name. This library is suitable for scenarios where different actions need to be taken based on varying input criteria. Concepts Pattern Matching Tables Pattern Matching Tables is a concept of providing a Table representation of the matching shape of the incoming message. Here are the rules: lua { \"Action\" = \"Do-Something\" } -- Match any message via a table of tags it must contain { \"Recipient\" = '_' } -- Match messages that have a recipient tag with any value.. { \"Quantity\" = \"%d+\" } -- Validate a tag against a Lua string match (similar to regular expressions) { \"Quantity\" = function (v) return tonumber (v) ~= Nil end } -- Apply a function to the tag to check it. Nil or false do not match Example: if you want to match on every message with the Action equal to \"Balance\" lua { Action = \"Balance\" } if you want to match on every message with the Quantity being a Number lua { Quantity = \"%d+\" } Resolvers Resolvers are tables in which each key is a pattern matching table and the value is a function that is executed based on the matching key. This allows developers to create case like statements in the resolver property. lua handlers.add ( \"foobarbaz\" , { Action = \"Update\" }, { [{ Status = \"foo\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"foo\" ) end , [{ Status = \"bar\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"bar\" ) end , [{ Status = \"baz\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"baz\" ) end }) Module Structure Handlers._version : String representing the version of the Handlers library. Handlers.list : Table storing the list of registered handlers. Handler method common function signature Parameter Type Description name string The identifier of the handler item in the handlers list. pattern Table or Function This parameter can take a table that specifies a pattern that the message MUST match, for example { Action = \"Balance\", Recipient = \"_\" } this table describes a message that has a Tag called action and it equals the string \"Balance\", and the message MUST have a Recipient Tag with a value. If you are unable to add a pattern via a table, you can also use the function which receives the message DataItem as its argument and you can return a true , false or \"continue\" result. The true result tells the Handlers evaluation pipeline to invoke this handler and exit out of the pipeline. The false result tells the Handlers evaluation pipeline to skip this handler and try to find a pattern matched by the next Handler item in the pipeline. Finally, the \"continue\" informs the Handlers evaluation to invoke this handler and continue evaluating. handler Table (Resolver) or Function This parameter can take a table that acts as a conditional that invokes a function based on a pattern matched key. or a Function that takes the message DataItem as an argument and performs some business logic. maxRuns (optional) number As of 0.0.5, each handler function takes an optional function to define the amount of times the handler should match before it is removed. The default is infinity. Functions Handlers.add(name, pattern, handler) adds a new handler or updates an existing handler by name Handlers.append(name, pattern, handle) Appends a new handler to the end of the handlers list. Handlers.once(name, pattern, handler) Only runs once when the pattern is matched. Handlers.prepend(name, pattern, handle) Prepends a new handler to the beginning of the handlers list. Handlers.before(handleName) Returns an object that allows adding a new handler before a specified handler. Handlers.after(handleName) Returns an object that allows adding a new handler after a specified handler. Handlers.remove(name) Removes a handler from the handlers list by name. Examples Using pattern Table lua handlers.add ( \"ping\" , { Action = \"ping\" }, function (msg) print ( 'ping' ) msg. reply ({Data = \"pong\" }) end ) Using resolvers lua handlers.add ( \"foobarbaz\" , { Action = \"Speak\" }, { [{Status = \"foo\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"foo\" ) end , [{Status = \"bar\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"bar\" ) end , [{Status = \"baz\" }] = function (msg) print ( \"baz\" ) end }) Using functions lua handlers.add ( \"example\" , function (msg) return msg. Action == \"Speak\" end , function (msg) print (msg. Status ) end ) Notes Handlers are executed in the order they appear in handlers.list . The pattern function should return false to skip the handler, true to break after the handler is executed, or \"continue\" to execute handler and continue with the next handler. Handlers.utils The Handlers.utils module provides two functions that are common matching patterns and one function that is a common handle function. hasMatchingData(data) hasMatchingTag(name, value) reply(txt) Handlers.utils.hasMatchingData(data : string) This helper returns a function that requires a message argument, so you can drop this into the pattern argument of any handler. The function compares the data on the incoming message with the string provided as an argument. lua handlers.add ( \"ping\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingData ( \"ping\" ), ... ) If a message comes into the process with data set to ping, this handler will match on it and invoke the handle function. Handlers.hasMatchingTag(name : string, value : string) This helper returns a function that requires a message argument, so you can drop this into any pattern argument on the Handlers module. The function compares the Tag Name and Value, if they are equal then it invokes the handle function. lua handlers.add ( \"ping\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingData ( \"ping\" ), ... ) Handlers.reply(text : string) This helper is a simple handle function, it basically places the text value in to the Data property of the outbound message. lua handlers.add ( \"ping\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingData ( \"ping\" ), Handlers. utils . reply ( \"pong\" ) ) Pager Previous page ao Module Next page Token \n\nURL: https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/references/token.html\nao Token and Subledger Specification Status: DRAFT-1 Targeting Network: ao.TN.1 This specification describes the necessary message handlers and functionality required for a standard ao token process. Implementations of this standard typically offer users the ability to control a transferrable asset, whose scarcity is maintained by the process. Each compliant process will likely implement a ledger of balances in order to encode ownership of the asset that the process represents. Compliant processes have a set of methods that allow for the modification of this ledger, typically with safe-guards to ensure the scarcity of ownership of the token represented by the process. Additionally, this specification describes a 'subledger' process type which, when implemented, offers the ability to split move a number of the tokens from the parent into a child process that implements the same token interface specification. If the From-Module of the subledger process is trusted by the participants, these subledgers can be used to transact in the 'source' token, without directly exchanging messages with it. This allows participants to use the tokens from a process, even if that process is congested. Optionally, if the participants trust the Module a subledger process is running, they are able to treat balances across these processes as fungible . The result of this is that an arbitrary numbers of parallel processes -- and thus, transactions -- can be processed by a single token at any one time. Token Processes A specification-compliant token process responds to a number of different forms of messages, with each form specified in an Action tag. The full set of Action messages that the token must support are as follows: Name Description Read-Only Balance get the balance of an identifer ✔️ Balances get a list of all ledger/account balances ✔️ Transfer send 1 or more units from the callers balance to one or move targets with the option to notify targets ❌ Mint if the ledger process is the root and you would like to increase token supply ❌ In the remainder of this section the tags necessary to spawn a compliant token process, along with the form of each of the Action messages and their results is described. Spawning Parameters Every compliant token process must carry the following immutable parameters upon its spawning message: Tag Description Optional? Name The title of the token, as it should be displayed to users. ✔️ Ticker A suggested shortened name for the token, such that it can be referenced quickly. ✔️ Logo An image that applications may deserire to show next to the token, in order to make it quickly visually identifiable. ✔️ Denomination The number of the token that should be treated as a single unit when quantities and balances are displayed to users. ❌ Messaging Protocol Balance(Target? : string) Returns the balance of a target, if a target is not supplied then the balance of the sender of the message must be returned. Example Action message: lua send ({ Target = \"{TokenProcess Identifier}\" , Tags = { Action = \"Balance\" , Target = \"{IDENTIFIER}\" } }) Example response message: { Tags = { Balance = \"50\", Target = \"LcldyO8wwiGDzC3iXzGofdO8JdR4S1_2A6Qtz-o33-0\", Ticker = \"FUN\" } } Balances() Returns the balance of all participants in the token. lua send ({ Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\" , Tags = { Action = \"Balances\" , Limit = 1000 , # TODO : Is this necessary if the user is paying for the compute and response? Cursor? = \"BalanceIdentifer\" } }) Example response message: lua { Data = { \"MV8B3MAKTsUOqyCzQ0Tsa2AR3TiWTBU1Dx0xM4MO-f4\" : 100 , \"LcldyO8wwiGDzC3iXzGofdO8JdR4S1_2A6Qtz-o33-0\" : 50 } } Transfer(Target, Quantity) If the sender has a sufficient balance, send the Quantity to the Target , issuing a Credit-Notice to the recipient and a Debit-Notice to the sender. The Credit- and Debit-Notice should forward any and all tags from the original Transfer message with the X- prefix. If the sender has an insufficient balance, fail and notify the sender. lua send ({ Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\" , Tags = { { name = \"Action\" , value = \"Transfer\" }, { name = \"Recipient\" , value = \"[ADDRESS]\" }, { name = \"Quantity\" , value = \"100\" }, { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\" , value = \"[VALUE]\" } } }) If a successful transfer occurs a notification message should be sent if Cast is not set. lua ao. send ({ Target = \"[Recipient Address]\" , Tags = { { name = \"Action\" , value = \"Credit-Notice\" }, { name = \"Sender\" , value = \"[ADDRESS]\" }, { name = \"Quantity\" , value = \"100\" }, { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\" , value = \"[VALUE]\" } } }) Recipients will infer from the From-Process tag of the message which tokens they have received. Get-Info() lua send ({ Target = \"{Token}\" , Tags = { Action = \"Info\" } }) Mint() [optional] Implementing a Mint action gives the process a way of allowing valid participants to create new tokens. lua send ({ Target = \"{Token Process}\" , Tags = { Action = \"Mint\" , Quantity = \"1000\" } }) Subledger Processes In order to function appropriately, subledgers must implement the full messaging protocol of token contracts (excluding the Mint action). Subledgers must also implement additional features and spawn parameters for their processes. These modifications are described in the following section. Spawning Parameters Every compliant subledger process must carry the following immutable parameters upon its spawning message: Tag Description Optional? Source-Token The ID of the top-most process that this subledger represents. ❌ Parent-Token The ID of the parent process that this subledger is attached to. ❌ Credit-Notice Handler Upon receipt of a Credit-Notice message, a compliant subledger process must check if the process in question is the Parent-Token . If it is, the subledger must increase the balance of the Sender by the specified quantity. Transfer(Target, Quantity) In addition to the normal tags that are passed in the Credit-Notice message to the recipient of tokens, a compliant subledger process must also provide both of the Source-Token and Parent-Token values. This allows the recipient of the Transfer message -- if they trust the Module of the subledger process -- to credit a receipt that is analogous (fungible with) deposits from the Source-Token . The modified Credit-Notice should be structured as follows: lua ao. send ({ Target = \"[Recipient Address]\" , Tags = { { name = \"Action\" , value = \"Credit-Notice\" }, { name = \"Quantity\" , value = \"100\" }, { name = \"Source-Token\" , value = \"[ADDRESS]\" }, { name = \"Parent-Token\" , value = \"[ADDRESS]\" }, { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\" , value = \"[VALUE]\" } } }) Withdraw(Target?, Quantity) All subledgers must allow balance holders to withdraw their tokens to the parent ledger. Upon receipt of an Action: Withdraw message, the subledger must send an Action message to its Parent-Ledger , transferring the requested tokens to the caller's address, while debiting their account locally. This transfer will result in a Credit-Notice from the Parent-Ledger for the caller. lua send ({ Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\" , Tags = { { name = \"Action\" , value = \"Withdraw\" }, { name = \"Recipient\" , value = \"[ADDRESS]\" }, { name = \"Quantity\" , value = \"100\" } } }) Token Example NOTE: When implementing a token it is important to remember that all Tags on a message MUST be \"string\"s. Using the tostring function you can convert simple types to strings. lua if not balances then balances = { [ao. id ] = 100000000000000 } end if name ~= \"Fun Coin\" then name = \"Fun Coin\" end if ticker ~= \"Fun\" then ticker = \"fun\" end if denomination ~= 6 then denomination = 6 end -- handlers that handler incoming msg handlers.add ( \"transfer\" , handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( \"Action\" , \"Transfer\" ), function (msg) assert ( type (msg.

In order, to request data from arweave, you simply call Assign with a list of processes you would like to assign the data to, and a Message which is the txid of a Message. lua Assign ({ Processes = { ao. id }, Message = 'message-id' }) You can also call Send with a table of process ids in the Assignments parameter. This will tell the network to generate the Message and then assign it to all the process ids in the Assignments list. lua Send ({ Target = ao. id , Data = 'Hello World' , Assignments = { 'process-id-1' , 'process-id-2' } }) Why data from Arweave? Your Process may need to access data from a message to make a decision about something, or you may want to add features to your Process via the data load feature. Or you may want to access a Message from a process without replicating the entire message.

These messages automatically get evaluated by a monitoring process to inform the Process to evalute these messages over time. The result is a real-time Process that can communicate with the full ao network or oracles in the outside network. Setting up cron in a process The easiest way to create these cron messages is by spawning a new process in the aos console and defining the time interval. sh aos [myProcess] --cron 5-minutes When spawning a new process, you can pass a cron argument in your command-line followed by the interval you would like the cron to tick. If you want the messages to trigger in real-time you must initiate a monitor event. In aos, you simply call .monitor and it will kick off a worker process on the mu that triggers the cron messages from the cu . Then your Process will receive the cron messages every x-interval . lua .monitor If you wish to stop triggering the cron messages simply call .unmonitor and this will stop the triggering process, but the next time you send a message, the generated cron messages will still get created and processed. Handling cron messages Every cron message has an Action tag with the value Cron . Handlers can be defined to perform specific tasks autonomously, each time a cron message is received. lua handlers.add ( \"CronTick\" , -- handler name Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( \"Action\" , \"Cron\" ), -- handler pattern to identify cron message function () -- handler task to execute on cron message -- do something end ) Cron messages are a powerful utility that can be used to create \"autonomous agents\" with expansive capabilities.

This tutorial will walk you through the key global functions and variables available in the aos environment, giving you a foundational understanding of how to interact with and utilize aos effectively. 1. Introduction to Inbox What It Is : Inbox is a Lua table that stores all messages received by your process but not yet handled. How to Use : Check Inbox to see incoming messages. Iterate through Inbox[x] to process these messages. 2. Sending Messages with Send(Message) Functionality : Send(Message) is a global function to send messages to other processes. Usage Example : Send({Target = \"...\", Data = \"Hello, Process!\"}) sends a message with the data \"Hello, Process!\" to a specified process. 3. Creating Processes with Spawn(Module, Message) Purpose : Use Spawn(Module, Message) to create new processes. Example : Spawn(\"MyModule\", {Data = \"Start\"}) starts a new process using \"MyModule\" with the provided message. 4. Understanding Name and Owner Name : A string set during initialization, representing the process's name. Owner : Indicates the owner of the process. Changing this might restrict your ability to interact with your process. Important Note : Treat these as read-only to avoid issues. 5. Utilizing Handlers What They Are : Handlers is a table of helper functions for creating message handlers. Usage : Define handlers in Handlers to specify actions for different incoming messages based on pattern matching. 6. Data Representation with Dump Function : Dump converts any Lua table into a print-friendly format. How to Use : Useful for debugging or viewing complex table structures. Example: Dump(Inbox) prints the contents of Inbox . 7. Leveraging Utils Module Contents : Utils contains a collection of functional utilities like map , reduce , and filter . Usage : Great for data manipulation and functional programming patterns in Lua. For example, Utils.map(myTable, function(x) return x * 2 end) to double the values in a table. 8. Exploring the ao Core Library Description : ao is a core module that includes key functions for message handling and process management. Key Features : Includes functions for sending messages ( send ) and spawning processes ( spawn ), along with environment variables. Conclusion This brief tour introduces you to the primary globals and functionalities within the aos environment. With these tools at your disposal, you can create and manage processes, handle messages, and utilize Lua's capabilities to build efficient and responsive applications on the aos platform. Experiment with these features to get a deeper understanding and to see how they can be integrated into your specific use cases. Happy coding in aos!

Some $0RBT. Learn how to get $0RBT here Any Code Editor (VSCode, Sublime Text, etc) If you are ready with the above prerequisites, 🛠️ Let's Start Building Initialize the Project Create a new file named 0rbit-Get-Request.lua in your project directory. bash touch 0rbit-Get-Request.lua Initialize the Variables lua local json = require ( \"json\" ) _0RBIT = \"BaMK1dfayo75s3q1ow6AO64UDpD9SEFbeE8xYrY2fyQ\" _0RBT_POINTS = \"BUhZLMwQ6yZHguLtJYA5lLUa9LQzLXMXRfaq9FVcPJc\" FEE_AMOUNT = \"1000000000000\" -- 1 $0RBT BASE_URL = \"https://api.diadata.org/v1/assetQuotation/Arweave/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" ReceivedData = ReceivedData or {} Make the Request The following code contains the Handler that will send 1 $0RBT to the 0rbit process and make the GET request for the BASE_URL lua handlers.add ( \"Get-Request\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( \"Action\" , \"First-Get-Request\" ), function (msg) Send ({ Target = _0RBT_TOKEN, Action = \"Transfer\" , Recipient = _0RBIT, Quantity = FEE_AMOUNT, [ \"X-Url\" ] = BASE_URL, [ \"X-Action\" ] = \"Get-Real-Data\" }) print (Colors. green .. \"You have sent a GET Request to the 0rbit process.\" ) end ) Breakdown of the above code: Handlers.add is used to add a new handler to the ao process. Get-Request is the name of the handler. Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag is a function that checks if the incoming message has the matching tag same as the First-Get-Request . function(msg) is the function executed when the handler is called. Send is the function that takes several tags as the arguments and creates a message on the ao: Tag Description Target The processId of the recipient. In this case, it's the $0RBT token processId. Action The tag that defines the handler to be called in the recipient process. In this case it's Transfer Recipient The tag that accepts the processId to whom the $0RBT will be sent. In this case, it's the 0rbit processId. Quantity The amount of $0RBT to be sent. [\"X-Url\"] The forwarded-tag which contains the URL and the same will be used by the 0rbit process to fetch the data. [\"X-Action\"] The forwarded-tag which contains the action to be performed by the 0rbit process . In this case, it's Get-Real-Data . Receive Data The following code contains the Handler that will receive the data from the 0rbit process and print it. lua handlers.add ( \"Receive-Data\" , Handlers. utils . hasMatchingTag ( \"Action\" , \"Receive-Response\" ), function (msg) local res = json. decode (msg. Data ) ReceivedData = res print (Colors. green .. \"You have received the data from the 0rbit process.\" ) end ) Breakdown of the above code: Handlers.add is used to add a new handler to the ao process. Receive-Data is the name of the handler. Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag is a function that checks if the incoming message has the matching tag same as the Receive-Response . function(msg) is the function executed when the handler is called. json.decode is used to decode the JSON data received. ReceivedData = res stores the received data in the ReceivedData variable. 🏃 Run the process Create a new process and load the script bash aos 0rbitGetRequest --load 0rbit-Get-Request.lua The above command will create a new process with the name 0rbitGetRequest and load 0rbit-Get-Request.lua into it. Call the Handler Call the handler, who will create a request for the 0rbit process. bash Send( { Target= ao.id, Action=\"First-Get-Request\" } ) Upon the successful execution, you will receive the following messages in your terminal Check the Data To check the data stored in the ReceivedData variable, run the following command: bash ReceivedData Upon the successful execution, you will receive the JSON data in your terminal: json { Address = \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\" , Name = \"Arweave\" , Blockchain = \"Arweave\" , Signature = \"0x2cd98c6f29a044d732ffcbc1a1b11e6f93f97f760dd1c9e47717ca04cc500afd6d83ad65270b227ddbaeba713e329e31959c814620d8ca136e685565414673d101\" , Time = \"2024-08-14T14:05:59Z\" , Source = \"diadata.org\" , PriceYesterday = 21.446763148012, Symbol = \"AR\" , Price = 21.404398988798, VolumeYesterdayUSD = 14609998.02428 } Voila!

Unix is a powerful operating system, but in its design it is focused on two Principal \"Types\". Files and Programs. A File is data and a program is logic, when you combine the two you get information.\n\n`Input.file | TransformProgram | Output.file`\n\nYou may have done something like this on the command line without knowing what you are doing. Being able to connect files to programs and return files which can then be passed to other programs creates a complex system composed of simple applications. This is a very powerful idea.\n\nNow, lets talk about `ao` the hyper parallel computer, and lets change the idea of a File to the `ao` concept of a Message and the idea of a Program to the `ao` concept of a Process. The `ao` computer takes messages and sends them to Processes in which those Processes can output messages that can be sent to other Processes. The result is a complex system built on simple modular logic containers.\n\n`MessageA | Process | MessageB`\n\n![ao-messages](https://g8way.io/eAoqMqhwQ5vnpH_NJ6H2PiGgrcGDprtDIUH9Re2xcic)\n\nHere is a description of the process as outlined in the flowchart:\n\n1. A message is initiated from an ao Connect. This message is sent to the `mu` service using a POST request. The body of the request contains data following a protocol, labeled 'ao', and is of the type 'Message'.\n\n2. The `mu` service processes the POST request and forwards the message to the `su` service. This is also done using a POST request with the same data protocol and message type.\n\n3. The `su` service stores the assignment and message on Arweave.\n\n4. A GET request is made to the `cu` service to retrieve result based on a message ID. The `cu` is a service that evaluates messages on processes and can return result based on an individual message identifier.\n\n5. A GET request is made to the `su` service to retrieve the assignment and message. This request is looking for messages from a process ID, within a range of time from a start (from the last evaluation point) to (to the current messageId).\n\n6. The final step is to push any outbox Messages. It involves reviewing the messages and spawns in the Result Object. Based on the outcome of this check, the steps 2, 3, and 4 may be repeated for each relevant message or spawn.\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/index.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"First POST Request\"\n  link: \"../guides/0rbit/post-request\"\nnext:\n  text: \"Specifications\"\n  link: \"./specs\"\n---\n\n# Concepts\n\nao has a lot of concepts built into the design, but the core concepts are very simple principles:\n\n- Two core types: Messages and Processes\n- No shared state, only Holographic State\n- Decentralized Computer (Grid)\n\nBelow is a set of concept documents that break down the ao system into its distinct parts.\n\n- [Specifications](specs)\n- [Processes](processes)\n- [Messages](messages)\n- [Units](units)\n- [How messaging works](how-it-works)\n\n[[toc]]\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/lua.md\n```\n# A whistle stop tour of Lua.\n\nBefore we can explore ao in greater depth, let's take a moment to learn the basics of Lua: your companion for commanding aos processes.\n\nLua is a simple language with few surprises. If you know Javascript, it will feel like a simplified, purer version. If you are learning from-scratch, it will seem like a tiny language that focuses on the important stuff: Clean computation with sane syntax.\n\nIn this section we will cover the basics of Lua in just a few minutes. If you already know Lua, jump right through to the [next chapter]()\n\n## Jumping back into your aos process.\n\nFor the purpose of this tutorial, we will be assuming that you have already completed the [getting started](/welcome/getting-started) guide. If not, complete that first.\n\nIf you logged out of your process, you can always re-open it by running `aos` on your commandline, optionally specifying your key file with `--wallet [location]`.\n\n## Basic Lua expressions.\n\nIn the remainder of this primer we will quickly run through Lua's core features and syntax.\n\nTry out on the examples on your aos process as you go, or skip them if they are intuitive to you.\n\n- **Basic arithmetic**: Try some basic arithmetic, like `5 + 3`. After processing, you will see the result `8`. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` all work as you might expect. `%` is the symbol that Lua uses for modulus.\n- **Setting variables**: Type `a = 10` and press enter. This sets the variable `a` to 10. By convention (not enforced by the language), global variables start with a capital letter in Lua (for example `Handlers`).\n\n- **Using variables**: Now type `a * 2`. You will see `20`returned on the command line.\n- **String concatenation**: Say hello to yourself by executing `\"Hello, \" .. ao.id`.\n\n## Experimenting with conditional statements.\n\n- **If-Else**: Like most programming languages, Lua uses if-else blocks to conditionally execute code.\n\n  In your aos process, type `.editor` and press enter. This will open an in-line text editor within your command-line interface.\n\n  ```lua\n  aos_coolness = 9001\n  if aos_coolness > 9000 then\n      return \"aos is coolness is over 9000!\"\n  else\n      return \"Oh. 🤷\"\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Once you are finished editing on your terminal, type `.done` on a new line and press enter. This will terminate edit mode and submit the expression to your process for evaluation.\n\n  As a result, you will see that aos is >9,000 cool. Good to know.\n\n  `if` statements in Lua can also have additional `elseif [condition] then` blocks, making conditional execution hierarchies easier.\n\n## Looping in Lua.\n\nThere are a few different ways to loop in your code in Lua. Here are our favorites:\n\n- **While loops**:\n\n  Start by initializing your counter to zero by typing `n = 0` and pressing enter.\n\n  Then open the inline editor again with `.editor` .\n\n  ```lua\n  while n < 5 do\n    n = n + 1\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Type `.done` on a new line to execute the while loop. You can check the result of the loop by simply running `n`.\n\n- **For loops**:\n\n  Lua can also execute python-style `for` loops between a set of values. For example, use the `.editor` to enter the following code block:\n\n  ```lua\n  for m = 1, 100 do\n          n = n + m\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Request the new value of the variable by running `n` again.\n\n## Getting functional.\n\n- **Define a function**:\n\n  Using the `.editor` once again, submit the following lines:\n\n  ```lua\n  function greeting(name)\n      return \"Hello, \" .. name\n  end\n  ```\n\n  Once submitted, aos will return `undefined`, as function (and variable) definition in Lua doesn't return a value.\n\n  Lua also has 'anonymous' or 'higher order' functions. These essentially allow you to use functions themselves as if they are normal data -- to be passed as arguments to other functions, etc. The following example defines an anonymous function and is equivalent to the above:\n\n  ```lua\n  greeting =\n  \t\tfunction(name)\n      \treturn \"Hello, \" .. name\n  \t\tend\n  ```\n\n- **Calling the function**: Call the function with `greeting(\"Earthling\")`. aos will return `\"Hello, Earthling\"`.\n\n## Defining deep objects with tables.\n\nTables are Lua's only compound data structure. They map `keys` to `values`, but can also be used like traditional arrays.\n\n- **Create a simple table**: Type `ao_is = {\"hyper\", \"parallel\", \"compute\"}`to create a simple table.\n- **Accessing the table's elements**: Access an element with `ao_is[2]`. aos will return `parallel`. Note: Indices in Lua start from 1!\n- **Count a table's elements**: The size of a table in Lua is found with the operator `#`. For example, running `#ao_is` will return `3`.\n- **Set a named element**: Type `ao_is[\"cool\"] = true` to add a new named key to the table. Named elements can also be accessed with the `.` operator, for example `ao_is.cool`.\n\n## Lua Wats.\n\naos uses Lua because it is a simple, clean language that most experienced programmers can learn very quickly, and is an increasingly popular first programming language, too, thanks to its use in video games like Roblox.\n\nNonetheless, there are a few things about the language that are prone to trip up rookie Lua builders. Tastes may vary, but here is our exhaustive list of Lua [wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)s:\n\n- **Remember:** Table indexing starts from 1 not 0!\n- **Remember:** 'Not equals' is expressed with `~=`, rather than `!=` or similar.\n- **Remember:** Objects in Lua are called 'tables', rather than their more common names.\n\n## Let's go!\n\nWith this in mind, you now know everything you need in order to build awesome decentralized processes with Lua! In the next chapter we will begin to build parallel processes with Lua and aos.\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/messages.md\n```\n# Messages\n\nThe Message serves as the fundamental data protocol unit within ao, crafted from [ANS-104 DataItems](https://specs.g8way.io/?tx=xwOgX-MmqN5_-Ny_zNu2A8o-PnTGsoRb_3FrtiMAkuw), thereby aligning with the native structure of Arweave. When engaged in a Process, a Message is structured as follows:\n\n```lua\n{\n    Cron = false,\n    Data = \"Hello aos\",\n    Epoch = 0,\n    From = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\",\n    Id = \"ayVo53qvZswpvxLlhMf8xmGjwxN0LGuHzzQpTLT0_do\",\n    Nonce = 1,\n    Owner = \"z1pq2WzmaYnfDwvEFgUZBj48anUsxxN64ZjbWOsIn08\",\n    Signature = \"...\",\n    Tags = {\n        Type = \"Message\",\n        Variant = \"ao.TN.1\",\n        [\"Data-Protocol\"] = \"ao\",\n        [\"From-Module\"] = \"lXfdCypsU3BpYTWvupgTioLoZAEOZL2_Ihcqepz6RiQ\",\n        [\"From-Process\"] = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\"\n    },\n    Target = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\",\n    Timestamp = 1704936415711,\n    [\"Block-Height\"] = 1340762,\n    [\"Forwarded-By\"] = \"z1pq2WzmaYnfDwvEFgUZBj48anUsxxN64ZjbWOsIn08\",\n    [\"Hash-Chain\"] = \"hJ0B-0yxKxeL3IIfaIIF7Yr6bFLG2vQayaF8G0EpjbY\"\n}\n```\n\nThis architecture merges the Assignment Type with the Message Type, granting the Process a comprehensive understanding of the Message's context for effective processing.\n\nWhen sending a message, here is a visual diagram of how the messages travels through the ao computer.\n\n![Message Workflow](message-workflow-diagram.png)\n\nThe message workflow initiates with the MU (Messenger Unit), where the message's signature is authenticated. Following this, the SU (Scheduler Unit) allocates an Epoch and Nonce to the message, bundles the message with an Assignment Type, and dispatches it to Arweave. Subsequently, the `aoconnect` library retrieves the outcome from the CU (Compute Unit). The CU then calls for all preceding messages leading up to the current Message Id from the SU (Scheduler Unit), processes them to deduce the result. Upon completion, the computed result is conveyed back to `aoconnect`, which is integrated within client interfaces such as `aos`.\n\n## Ethereum Signed Message\n\nIf the Message [ANS-104 DataItem](https://specs.g8way.io/?tx=xwOgX-MmqN5_-Ny_zNu2A8o-PnTGsoRb_3FrtiMAkuw) was signed using Ethereum keys,\nthen the value in the `Owner` and `From` fields will be the\n[EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-55.md) Ethereum address of the signer.\nFor example: `0xfB6916095ca1df60bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359`.\n\n## Summary\n\nMessages serve as the primary data protocol type for the ao network, leveraging ANS-104 Data-Items native to Arweave. Messages contain several fields including data content, origin, target, and cryptographic elements like signatures and nonces. They follow a journey starting at the Messenger Unit (MU), which ensures they are signed, through the Scheduler Unit (SU) that timestamps and sequences them, before being bundled and published to Arweave. The `aoconnect` library then reads the result from the Compute Unit (CU), which processes messages to calculate results and sends responses back through `aoconnect`, utilized by clients such as `aos`. The CU is the execution environment for these processes.\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/processes.md\n```\n# Processes\n\nProcesses possess the capability to engage in communication via message passing, both receiving and dispatching messages within the network. Additionally, they hold the potential to instantiate further processes, enhancing the network's computational fabric. This dynamic method of data dissemination and interaction within the network is referred to as a 'holographic state', underpinning the shared and persistent state of the network.\n\n![Process-Diagram](process-diagram.png)\n\nWhen building a Process with `aos` you have the ability to add `handlers`, these handlers can be added by calling the `Handlers.add` function, passing a \"name\", a \"match\" function, and a \"handle\" function.\n\n![Handler Diagram](handler-diagram.png)\n\nThe core module contains a helper library that gets injected into the handler function, this library is called `ao`.\n\n```lua\n{\n    env = {\n        Process = {\n            Id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\",\n            Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\",\n            Tags = {...}\n        },\n        Module = {\n            Id = \"UAUszdznoUPQvXRbrFuIIH6J0N_LnJ1h4Trej28UgrE\",\n            Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\",\n            Tags = {..}\n        }\n    },\n    id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\",\n    isTrusted = \"function: 0x5468d0\",\n    result = \"function: 0x547120\",\n    send = \"function: 0x547618\",\n    spawn = \"function: 0x5468b0\"\n}\n```\n\nThe main functions to look at in this `ao` helper is\n\n- ao.send(Message) - sends a message to a process\n- ao.spawn(Module, Message) - creates a new process\n\n## Ethereum Signed Process or Module\n\nFor an `ao` `Process` or `Module`, if the [ANS-104 DataItem](https://specs.g8way.io/?tx=xwOgX-MmqN5_-Ny_zNu2A8o-PnTGsoRb_3FrtiMAkuw) was signed using Ethereum keys,\nthen the value in the `env.Process.Owner` or `env.Module.Owner` field, respectively, will be the\n[EIP-55](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-55.md) Ethereum address of the signer.\nFor example: `0xfB6916095ca1df60bB79Ce92cE3Ea74c37c5d359`\n\n## ao.send Example\n\n```lua\nao.send({\n    Target = Chatroom,\n    Action = \"Broadcast\",\n    Data = \"Hello from my Process!\"\n})\n```\n\n## ao.spawn Example\n\n```lua\nao.spawn(ao.env.Module.Id, {\n    [\"Memory-Limit\"] = \"500-mb\",\n    [\"Compute-Limit\"] = \"900000000000000000\"\n})\n```\n\n## ao.env\n\n> NOTE: `ao.env` is important context data that you may need as a developer creating processes.\n\nThe `ao.env` property contains the `Process` and `Module` Reference Objects\n\n```lua\nenv = {\n    Process = {\n        Id = \"5WzR7rJCuqCKEq02WUPhTjwnzllLjGu6SA7qhYpcKRs\",\n        Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\",\n        Tags = {...}\n    },\n    Module = {\n        Id = \"UAUszdznoUPQvXRbrFuIIH6J0N_LnJ1h4Trej28UgrE\",\n        Owner = \"_r9LpP4FtClpsGX3TOohubyaeb0IQTZZMcxQ24tTsGo\",\n        Tags = {..}\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBoth the `Process` and the `Module` contain the attributes of the `ao` Data-Protocol.\n\n## Summary\n\nProcesses in the network communicate through message passing and can create new processes, contributing to a 'holographic state' of shared and persistent data. Developers can build a Process using `aos` by adding handlers through the `Handlers.add` function with specific name, match, and handle functions. The `ao` helper library within the core module aids in this process, providing functions like `ao.send` to dispatch messages and `ao.spawn` to create new modules, as well as the important `ao.env` property which contains essential Process and Module information. The `ao` Data-Protocol outlines the structure and attributes of these elements.\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/specs.md\n```\n# ao Specs\n\n### What is `ao`?\n\nThe `ao` computer is the [actor oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) machine that emerges from the network of nodes that adhere to its core data protocol, running on the [Arweave](https://arweave.org) network. This document gives a brief introduction to the protocol and its functionality, as well as its technical details, such that builders can create new implementations and services that integrate with it.\n\nThe `ao` computer is a single, unified computing environment (a [Single System Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_system_image)), hosted on a heterogenous set of nodes in a distributed network. `ao` is designed to offer an environment in which an arbitrary number of parallel processes can be resident, coordinating through an open message passing layer. This message passing standard connects the machine's independently operating processes together into a 'web' -- in the same way that websites operate on independent servers but are conjoined into a cohesive, unified experience via hyperlinks.\n\n[Learn More](https://ao.g8way.io/#/read)\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/tour.md\n```\n# aos Brief Tour\n\nWelcome to a quick tour of aos! This tutorial will walk you through the key global functions and variables available in the aos environment, giving you a foundational understanding of how to interact with and utilize aos effectively.\n\n## 1. Introduction to Inbox\n\n- **What It Is**: `Inbox` is a Lua table that stores all messages received by your process but not yet handled.\n- **How to Use**: Check `Inbox` to see incoming messages. Iterate through `Inbox[x]` to process these messages.\n\n## 2. Sending Messages with Send(Message)\n\n- **Functionality**: `Send(Message)` is a global function to send messages to other processes.\n- **Usage Example**: `Send({Target = \"...\", Data = \"Hello, Process!\"})` sends a message with the data \"Hello, Process!\" to a specified process.\n\n## 3. Creating Processes with Spawn(Module, Message)\n\n- **Purpose**: Use `Spawn(Module, Message)` to create new processes.\n- **Example**: `Spawn(\"MyModule\", {Data = \"Start\"})` starts a new process using \"MyModule\" with the provided message.\n\n## 4. Understanding Name and Owner\n\n- **Name**: A string set during initialization, representing the process's name.\n- **Owner**: Indicates the owner of the process. Changing this might restrict your ability to interact with your process.\n- **Important Note**: Treat these as read-only to avoid issues.\n\n## 5. Utilizing Handlers\n\n- **What They Are**: `Handlers` is a table of helper functions for creating message handlers.\n- **Usage**: Define handlers in `Handlers` to specify actions for different incoming messages based on pattern matching.\n\n## 6. Data Representation with Dump\n\n- **Function**: `Dump` converts any Lua table into a print-friendly format.\n- **How to Use**: Useful for debugging or viewing complex table structures. Example: `Dump(Inbox)` prints the contents of `Inbox`.\n\n## 7. Leveraging Utils Module\n\n- **Contents**: Utils contains a collection of functional utilities like`map`, `reduce`, and `filter`.\n\n- **Usage**: Great for data manipulation and functional programming patterns in Lua. For example, `Utils.map(myTable, function(x) return x * 2 end)` to double the values in a table.\n\n## 8. Exploring the ao Core Library\n\n- **Description**: `ao` is a core module that includes key functions for message handling and process management.\n- **Key Features**: Includes functions for sending messages (`send`) and spawning processes (`spawn`), along with environment variables.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis brief tour introduces you to the primary globals and functionalities within the aos environment. With these tools at your disposal, you can create and manage processes, handle messages, and utilize Lua's capabilities to build efficient and responsive applications on the aos platform. Experiment with these features to get a deeper understanding and to see how they can be integrated into your specific use cases. Happy coding in aos!\n\n```\n\n## File: concepts/units.md\n```\n# Units\n\n\n## What is a Unit?\n\nThe ao Computer is composed of three Unit types, each type contains a set of responsibilities for the computer. And each Unit is horizontally scalable.\n\nIn ao we have the `Messager Unit` or `MU`, and the `Scheduler Unit` or `SU`, and the `Compute Unit` or the `CU`. These units are the building blocks of the ao Computer Grid. There can be 1 or more of these units on the network and they work together to power the ao Operating System or `aos`.\n\n![MU](MU-diagram.png)\n\n- Messager Unit - This unit is the front door to ao, it receives all the messages from the outside and as well as directs traffic flow for Processes. This traffic flow we call `pushing`. Each process can return an Outbox when it evaluates a Message, and this Outbox can be filled with Messages or requests to Spawn new processes, and the Messenger Unit is responsible for extracting these Messages from the Outbox and signing them and sending them to the Scheduler Units for processing.\n\n![SU Diagram](SU-diagram.png)\n\n- Scheduler Unit - The Scheduler unit is responsible for ordering the messages, and storing those messages on Arweave. It is important that every message is appropriately ordered so that the evaluation can be replayed and verified. The Scheduler Unit is responsible for this process. It provides the abilty to query it via an endpoint to get the order of messages for evaluation.\n\n![CU Diagram](CU-diagram.png)\n\n- Compute Unit - The Compute unit is responsible for compute, this unit loads the binary module and manages the memory of that module, so that the execution of the process is alway running on the most up to date memory. The compute unit provides the results of the evaluation back to the the messenger unit, which can then push any messages in the outbox of the given process.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe ao Computer consists of three scalable unit types—Messager Unit (MU), Scheduler Unit (SU), and Compute Unit (CU)—which form the foundation of the ao Computer. These units can exist in multiples on the network and collectively operate the ao Operating System (aos).\n\nThe MU acts as the entry point, receiving external messages and managing process communications. It processes outgoing messages and spawn requests from process outboxes and forwards them to the SU.\n\nThe SU ensures messages are properly sequenced and stored on Arweave, maintaining order for consistent replay and verification of message evaluations.\n\nThe CU handles computation, loading binary modules, and managing memory to ensure processes run with current data. It then returns the evaluation results to the MU for further message handling.\n\n```\n\n## File: guides/index.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"Expanding the Arena\"\n  link: \"/tutorials/bots-and-games/build-game\"\nnext:\n  text: \"aos\"\n  link: \"./aos/index\"\n---\n\n# Guides\n\nThese guides are designed to help you navigate ao and aos, and to help you build everything from chatrooms to autonomous, decentralized bots, and more.\n\n## Full Courses\n\n- [AOS: Compute on AO](aos/index)\n- [Connect: Javascript/library](aoconnect/aoconnect)\n\n## Snacks\n\n- [CLI: AO Module Builder](dev-cli/index)\n- [Using WeaveDrive](snacks/weavedrive)\n- [Using Sqlite](snacks/sqlite)\n\n## Additional\n\n- [Community](/community/index)\n- [Release Notes](/releasenotes/index)\n\n```\n\n## File: guides/snacks/sqlite.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"Guides\"\n  link: \"/guides/index\"\n\nnext: false\n---\n\n# Getting started with Sqlite\n\nSqlite is a relational database engine.

But how to use it with your process? This post aims to provide a step by step guide on how to use WeaveDrive in your AOS process.\n\nThe current availability time is called `Assignments` and this type puts WeaveDrive in a mode that allows you to define an Attestor wallet address when you create your AOS process. This will enable the process to load data from dataItems that have a Attestation created by this wallet.\n\n## Prep Tutorial\n\nIn order, to setup the tutorial for success we need to upload some data and upload an attestation.

These messages automatically get evaluated by a monitoring process to inform the Process to evaluate these messages over time. The result is a real-time Process that can communicate with the full ao network or oracles in the outside network.\n\n## Setting up cron in a process\n\nThe easiest way to create these cron messages is by spawning a new process in the aos console and defining the time interval.\n\n```sh\naos [myProcess] --cron 5-minutes\n```\n\nWhen spawning a new process, you can pass a cron argument in your command-line followed by the interval you would like the cron to tick. If you want the messages to trigger in real-time you must initiate a monitor event. In aos, you simply call `.monitor` and it will kick off a worker process on the `mu` that triggers the cron messages from the `cu`. Then your Process will receive the cron messages every `x-interval`.\n\n```lua\n.monitor\n```\n\nIf you wish to stop triggering the cron messages simply call `.unmonitor` and this will stop the triggering process, but the next time you send a message, the generated cron messages will still get created and processed.\n\n## Handling cron messages\n\nEvery cron message has an `Action` tag with the value `Cron`. [Handlers](handlers.md) can be defined to perform specific tasks autonomously, each time a cron message is received.\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\n  \"CronTick\", -- handler name\n  Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Cron\"), -- handler pattern to identify cron message\n  function () -- handler task to execute on cron message\n    -- do something\n  end\n)\n```\n\nCron messages are a powerful utility that can be used to create \"autonomous agents\" with expansive capabilities.\n\n```\n\n## File: references/data.md\n```\n# Accessing Data from Arweave with ao\n\nThere may be times in your ao development workflow that you want to access data from arweave. With ao your process can send an assignment instructing the network to provide that data to your Process.\n\nIn order, to request data from arweave, you simply call Assign with a list of processes you would like to assign the data to, and a Message which is the txid of a Message.\n\n```lua\n\nAssign({\n  Processes = { ao.id },\n  Message = 'message-id'\n})\n\n```\n\nYou can also call Send with a table of process ids in the Assignments parameter. This will tell the network to generate the Message and then assign it to all the process ids in the Assignments list.\n\n```lua\nSend({\n  Target = ao.id,\n  Data = 'Hello World',\n  Assignments = { 'process-id-1', 'process-id-2' }\n})\n```\n\n## Why data from Arweave?\n\nYour Process may need to access data from a message to make a decision about something, or you may want to add features to your Process via the `data` load feature. Or you may want to access a Message from a process without replicating the entire message.\n\n```\n\n## File: references/eval.md\n```\n# Eval \n\nEach AO process includes an onboard `Eval` handler that evaluates any new code it receives. This handler enables the process to determine the appropriate action for the incoming code and verifies if the message originates from the process owner.\n\nThe `Eval` handler can also be manually triggered to evaluate received Data from an incoming message.\n\n## Sending an Eval Message in NodeJS\n```js\nimport { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\";\nimport { message, createDataItemSigner } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\";\n\nconst wallet = JSON.parse(\n  readFileSync(\"/path/to/arweave/wallet.json\").toString()\n);\n\nawait message({\n  // The arweave TXID of the process, this will become the \"target\".\n  process: \"process-id\", // Replace with the actual process ID\n\n  // Tagging the Eval Action so the receiving process evaluates and adds the new Handler from the Data field.\n  tags: [\n    { name: \"Action\", value: \"Eval\" },\n    { name: \"Data\", value: 'Handlers.add(\"ping\", Handlers.utils.reply(\"pong\"))' },\n  ],\n\n  // A signer function used to build the message \"signature\"\n  signer: createDataItemSigner(wallet),\n\n})\n  .then(console.log)\n  .catch(console.error);\n```\n\n## Sending an Eval Message in a Browser\n```js\nimport { message, createDataItemSigner } from \"@permaweb/aoconnect\";\n\nawait message({\n  // The arweave TXID of the process, this will become the \"target\".\n  process: \"process-id\", // Replace with the actual process ID\n\n  // Tagging the Eval Action so the receiving process evaluates and adds the new Handler from the Data field.\n  tags: [\n    { name: \"Action\", value: \"Eval\" },\n    { name: \"Data\", value: 'Handlers.add(\"ping\", Handlers.utils.reply(\"pong\"))' },\n  ],\n\n  // A signer function used to build the message \"signature\"\n  signer: createDataItemSigner(globalThis.arweaveWallet),\n\n})\n  .then(console.log)\n  .catch(console.error);\n```\n\n```\n\n## File: references/handlers.md\n```\n# Handlers (Version 0.0.5)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Handlers library provides a flexible way to manage and execute a series of process functions based on pattern matching. An AO process responds based on receiving Messages, these messages are defined using the Arweave DataItem specification which consists of Tags, and Data. Using the Handlers library, you can define a pipeline of process evaluation based on the attributes of the AO Message. Each handler items consists of a pattern function, a handle function, and a name. This library is suitable for scenarios where different actions need to be taken based on varying input criteria.\n\n## Concepts\n\n### Pattern Matching Tables\n\nPattern Matching Tables is a concept of providing a Table representation of the matching shape of the incoming message. Here are the rules:\n\n```lua\n\n{ \"Action\" = \"Do-Something\" } -- Match any message via a table of tags it must contain\n\n{ \"Recipient\" = '_' } -- Match messages that have a recipient tag with any value..\n\n{ \"Quantity\" = \"%d+\" } -- Validate a tag against a Lua string match (similar to regular expressions)\n\n{ \"Quantity\" = function(v) return tonumber(v) ~= Nil end } -- Apply a function to the tag to check it. Nil or false do not match\n```\n\nExample:\n\nif you want to match on every message with the Action equal to \"Balance\"\n\n```lua\n{ Action = \"Balance\" }\n```\n\nif you want to match on every message with the Quantity being a Number\n\n```lua\n{ Quantity = \"%d+\" }\n```\n\n### Resolvers\n\nResolvers are tables in which each key is a pattern matching table and the value is a function that is executed based on the matching key. This allows developers to create case like statements in the resolver property.\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\"foobarbaz\",\n  { Action = \"Update\" }, {\n  [{ Status = \"foo\" }] = function (msg) print(\"foo\") end,\n  [{ Status = \"bar\" }] = function (msg) print(\"bar\") end,\n  [{ Status = \"baz\" }] = function (msg) print(\"baz\") end\n})\n```\n\n## Module Structure\n\n- `Handlers._version`: String representing the version of the Handlers library.\n- `Handlers.list`: Table storing the list of registered handlers.\n\n## Handler method common function signature\n\n| Parameter          | Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| name               | string                       | The identifier of the handler item in the handlers list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| pattern            | Table or Function            | This parameter can take a table that specifies a pattern that the message MUST match, for example `{ Action = \"Balance\", Recipient = \"_\" }` this table describes a message that has a Tag called action and it equals the string \"Balance\", and the message MUST have a Recipient Tag with a value. If you are unable to add a pattern via a table, you can also use the `function` which receives the message DataItem as its argument and you can return a `true`, `false` or `\"continue\"` result. The `true` result tells the Handlers evaluation pipeline to invoke this handler and exit out of the pipeline. The `false` result tells the Handlers evaluation pipeline to skip this handler and try to find a pattern matched by the next Handler item in the pipeline. Finally, the `\"continue\"` informs the Handlers evaluation to invoke this handler and continue evaluating. |\n| handler            | Table (Resolver) or Function | This parameter can take a table that acts as a conditional that invokes a function based on a pattern matched key. or a Function that takes the message DataItem as an argument and performs some business logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| maxRuns (optional) | number                       | As of 0.0.5, each handler function takes an optional function to define the amount of times the handler should match before it is removed.

Implementations of this standard typically offer users the ability to control a transferrable asset, whose scarcity is maintained by the process.\n\nEach compliant process will likely implement a ledger of balances in order to encode ownership of the asset that the process represents. Compliant processes have a set of methods that allow for the modification of this ledger, typically with safe-guards to ensure the scarcity of ownership of the token represented by the process.\n\nAdditionally, this specification describes a 'subledger' process type which, when implemented, offers the ability to split move a number of the tokens from the parent into a child process that implements the same token interface specification. If the `From-Module` of the subledger process is trusted by the participants, these subledgers can be used to transact in the 'source' token, without directly exchanging messages with it. This allows participants to use the tokens from a process, even if that process is congested. Optionally, if the participants trust the `Module` a subledger process is running, they are able to treat balances across these processes as _fungible_. The result of this is that an arbitrary numbers of parallel processes -- and thus, transactions -- can be processed by a single token at any one time.\n\n# Token Processes\n\nA specification-compliant token process responds to a number of different forms of messages, with each form specified in an `Action` tag. The full set of `Action` messages that the token must support are as follows:\n\n| Name     | Description                                                                                            | Read-Only          |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |\n| Balance  | get the balance of an identifier                                                                        | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Balances | get a list of all ledger/account balances                                                              | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Transfer | send 1 or more units from the callers balance to one or move targets with the option to notify targets | :x:                |\n| Mint     | if the ledger process is the root and you would like to increase token supply                          | :x:                |\n\nIn the remainder of this section the tags necessary to spawn a compliant token process, along with the form of each of the `Action` messages and their results is described.\n\n## Spawning Parameters\n\nEvery compliant token process must carry the following immutable parameters upon its spawning message:\n\n| Tag          | Description                                                                                                           | Optional?          |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |\n| Name         | The title of the token, as it should be displayed to users.                                                           | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Ticker       | A suggested shortened name for the token, such that it can be referenced quickly.                                     | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Logo         | An image that applications may desire to show next to the token, in order to make it quickly visually identifiable. | :heavy_check_mark: |\n| Denomination | The number of the token that should be treated as a single unit when quantities and balances are displayed to users.  | :x:                |\n\n## Messaging Protocol\n\n### Balance(Target? : string)\n\nReturns the balance of a target, if a target is not supplied then the balance of the sender of the message must be returned.\n\nExample `Action` message:\n\n```lua=\nsend({\n    Target = \"{TokenProcess Identifier}\",\n    Tags = {\n        Action = \"Balance\",\n        Target = \"{IDENTIFIER}\"\n    }\n})\n```\n\nExample response message:\n\n```\n{\n    Tags = {\n        Balance = \"50\",\n        Target = \"LcldyO8wwiGDzC3iXzGofdO8JdR4S1_2A6Qtz-o33-0\",\n        Ticker = \"FUN\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Balances()\n\nReturns the balance of all participants in the token.\n\n```lua\nsend({\n    Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\",\n    Tags = {\n        Action = \"Balances\",\n        Limit = 1000, # TODO: Is this necessary if the user is paying for the compute and response?\n        Cursor? = \"BalanceIdentifier\"\n    }\n})\n```\n\nExample response message:\n\n```lua\n{\n    Data = {\n        \"MV8B3MAKTsUOqyCzQ0Tsa2AR3TiWTBU1Dx0xM4MO-f4\": 100,\n        \"LcldyO8wwiGDzC3iXzGofdO8JdR4S1_2A6Qtz-o33-0\": 50\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Transfer(Target, Quantity)\n\nIf the sender has a sufficient balance, send the `Quantity` to the `Target`, issuing a `Credit-Notice` to the recipient and a `Debit-Notice` to the sender. The `Credit-` and `Debit-Notice` should forward any and all tags from the original `Transfer` message with the `X-` prefix. If the sender has an insufficient balance, fail and notify the sender.\n\n```lua\nsend({\n    Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\",\n    Tags = {\n        { name = \"Action\", value = \"Transfer\" },\n        { name = \"Recipient\", value = \"[ADDRESS]\" },\n        { name = \"Quantity\", value = \"100\" },\n        { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\", value= \"[VALUE]\" }\n    }\n})\n```\n\nIf a successful transfer occurs a notification message should be sent if `Cast` is not set.\n\n```lua\nao.send({\n    Target = \"[Recipient Address]\",\n    Tags = {\n        { name = \"Action\", value = \"Credit-Notice\" },\n        { name = \"Sender\", value = \"[ADDRESS]\" },\n        { name = \"Quantity\", value = \"100\"},\n        { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\", value= \"[VALUE]\" }\n    }\n})\n```\n\nRecipients will infer from the `From-Process` tag of the message which tokens they have received.\n\n### Get-Info()\n\n```lua\nsend({\n    Target = \"{Token}\",\n    Tags = {\n        Action = \"Info\"\n    }\n})\n```\n\n### Mint() [optional]\n\nImplementing a `Mint` action gives the process a way of allowing valid participants to create new tokens.\n\n```lua\nsend({\n    Target =\"{Token Process}\",\n    Tags = {\n        Action = \"Mint\",\n        Quantity = \"1000\"\n    }\n})\n```\n\n# Subledger Processes\n\nIn order to function appropriately, subledgers must implement the full messaging protocol of token contracts (excluding the `Mint` action). Subledgers must also implement additional features and spawn parameters for their processes. These modifications are described in the following section.\n\n### Spawning Parameters\n\nEvery compliant subledger process must carry the following immutable parameters upon its spawning message:\n\n| Tag          | Description                                                        | Optional? |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |\n| Source-Token | The `ID` of the top-most process that this subledger represents.   | :x:       |\n| Parent-Token | The `ID` of the parent process that this subledger is attached to. | :x:       |\n\n### `Credit-Notice` Handler\n\nUpon receipt of a `Credit-Notice` message, a compliant subledger process must check if the process in question is the `Parent-Token`. If it is, the subledger must increase the balance of the `Sender` by the specified quantity.\n\n### Transfer(Target, Quantity)\n\nIn addition to the normal tags that are passed in the `Credit-Notice` message to the recipient of tokens, a compliant subledger process must also provide both of the `Source-Token` and `Parent-Token` values. This allows the recipient of the `Transfer` message -- if they trust the `Module` of the subledger process -- to credit a receipt that is analogous (fungible with) deposits from the `Source-Token`.\n\nThe modified `Credit-Notice` should be structured as follows:\n\n```lua\nao.send({\n    Target = \"[Recipient Address]\",\n    Tags = {\n        { name = \"Action\", value = \"Credit-Notice\" },\n        { name = \"Quantity\", value = \"100\"},\n        { name = \"Source-Token\", value = \"[ADDRESS]\" },\n        { name = \"Parent-Token\", value = \"[ADDRESS]\" },\n        { name = \"X-[Forwarded Tag(s) Name]\", value= \"[VALUE]\" }\n    }\n})\n```\n\n### Withdraw(Target?, Quantity)\n\nAll subledgers must allow balance holders to withdraw their tokens to the parent ledger. Upon receipt of an `Action: Withdraw` message, the subledger must send an `Action` message to its `Parent-Ledger`, transferring the requested tokens to the caller's address, while debiting their account locally. This transfer will result in a `Credit-Notice` from the `Parent-Ledger` for the caller.\n\n```lua\nsend({\n    Target = \"[TokenProcess Identifier]\",\n    Tags = {\n     { name = \"Action\", value = \"Withdraw\" },\n     { name = \"Recipient\", value = \"[ADDRESS]\" },\n     { name = \"Quantity\", value = \"100\" }\n    }\n})\n```\n\n# Token Example\n\n> NOTE: When implementing a token it is important to remember that all Tags on a message MUST be \"string\"s. Using the`tostring` function you can convert simple types to strings.\n\n```lua\nif not balances then\n  balances = { [ao.id] = 100000000000000 }\nend\n\nif name ~= \"Fun Coin\" then\n  name = \"Fun Coin\"\nend\n\nif ticker ~= \"Fun\" then\n  ticker = \"fun\"\nend\n\nif denomination ~= 6 then\n  denomination = 6\nend\n\n-- handlers that handler incoming msg\nhandlers.add(\n  \"transfer\",\n  handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Transfer\"),\n  function (msg)\n    assert(type(msg.Tags.Recipient) == 'string', 'Recipient is required!')\n    assert(type(msg.Tags.Quantity) == 'string', 'Quantity is required!')\n\n    if not balances[msg.From] then\n      balances[msg.From] = 0\n    end\n\n    if not balances[msg.Tags.Recipient] then\n      balances[msg.Tags.Recipient] = 0\n    end\n\n    local qty = tonumber(msg.Tags.Quantity)\n    assert(type(qty) == 'number', 'qty must be number')\n    -- handlers.utils.reply(\"Transferring qty\")(msg)\n    if balances[msg.From] >= qty then\n      balances[msg.From] = balances[msg.From] - qty\n      balances[msg.Tags.Recipient] = balances[msg.Tags.Recipient] + qty\n      ao.send({\n        Target = msg.From,\n        Tags = {\n          Action = \"Debit-Notice\",\n          Quantity = tostring(qty)\n        }\n      })\n      ao.send({\n      Target = msg.Tags.Recipient,\n      Tags = {\n        Action = \"Credit-Notice\",\n        Quantity = tostring(qty)\n      }})\n      -- if msg.Tags.Cast and msg.Tags.Cast == \"true\" then\n      --   return\n      -- end\n\n    end\n  end\n)\n\nhandlers.add(\n  \"balance\",\n  handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Balance\"),\n  function (msg)\n    assert(type(msg.Tags.Target) == \"string\", \"Target Tag is required!\")\n    local bal = \"0\"\n    if balances[msg.Tags.Target] then\n      bal = tostring(balances[msg.Tags.Target])\n    end\n    ao.send({Target = msg.From, Tags = {\n      Target = msg.From,\n      Balance = bal,\n      Ticker = ticker or \"\"\n    }})\n  end\n)\n\nlocal json = require(\"json\")\n\nhandlers.add(\n  \"balances\",\n  handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Balances\"),\n  function (msg)\n    ao.send({\n      Target = msg.From,\n      Data = json.encode(balances)\n    })\n  end\n\n)\n\nhandlers.add(\n  \"info\",\n  handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Info\"),\n  function (msg)\n    ao.send({Target = msg.From, Tags = {\n      Name = name,\n      Ticker = ticker,\n      Denomination = tostring(denomination)\n    }})\n  end\n)\n```\n\n```\n\n## File: references/wasm.md\n```\n# Meet Web Assembly\n\nWebAssembly (often abbreviated as Wasm) is a modern binary instruction format providing a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust. It enables deployment on the web for client and server applications, offering a high level of performance and efficiency. WebAssembly is designed to maintain the security and sandboxing features of web browsers, making it a suitable choice for web-based applications. It's a key technology for web developers, allowing them to write code in multiple languages and compile it into bytecode that runs in the browser at near-native speed.\n\nThe significance of WebAssembly lies in its ability to bridge the gap between web and native applications. It allows complex applications and games, previously limited to desktop environments, to run in the browser with comparable performance. This opens up new possibilities for web development, including the creation of high-performance web apps, games, and even the porting of existing desktop applications to the web. WebAssembly operates alongside JavaScript, complementing it by enabling performance-critical components to be written in languages better suited for such tasks, thereby enhancing the capabilities and performance of web applications.\n\n```\n\n## File: releasenotes/aos-2_0_0.md\n```\n# AOS Release Notes v2.0.1\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g https://get_ao.arweave.net\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- Bootloader\n- Handlers.once (defaults to prepend mode)\n- WeaveDrive with Attestors\n- WeaveDrive L2 Headers\n- Spawn module by name\n- Graphql Modules\n- msg.reply patch\n\n### Bootloader\n\nBootloader enables users to include a script to evaluate when spawning a process.

So that the `.receive` co-routine can properly catch the response sent by the calling AOS 2.0 process.\n\nThen open an older process:\n\n```sh\naos [my aos process]\n```\n\nAnd run `.load-blueprint patch-legacy-reply`\n\n```\n.load-blueprint patch-legacy-reply\n```\n\n## Source\n\nYou can review the blueprint source here:\n\nhttps://github.com/permaweb/aos/blob/main/blueprints/patch-legacy-reply.lua\n\n```lua\n-- patch reply\nlocal function patchReply(msg)\n  if not msg.reply then\n    msg.reply = function (replyMsg)\n      replyMsg.Target = msg[\"Reply-To\"] or (replyMsg.Target or msg.From)\n      replyMsg[\"X-Reference\"] = msg[\"X-Reference\"] or msg.Reference or \"\"\n      replyMsg[\"X-Origin\"] = msg[\"X-Origin\"] or \"\"\n\n      return ao.send(replyMsg)\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nHandlers.prepend(\"_patch_reply\", function (msg) return \"continue\" end, patchReply)\n\n```\n\n---\n\nFixes:\n\n- bubble up errors during co-routine resume functions - https://github.com/permaweb/aos/pull/374\n- update token.lua to check for .reply before using the replay method\n- staking blueprint improvement to default unstake delay block wait, and prepend finalize handler.\n- fixed bug with Handlers.remove - https://github.com/permaweb/aos/pull/366\n\n```\n\n## File: releasenotes/index.md\n```\n---\nnext:\n  text: \"Getting Started\"\n  link: \"./getting-started\"\n---\n\n# Release Notes\n\n- [AOS 2.0.1](aos-2_0_1)\n- [AOS 2.0.0](aos-2_0_0)\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/chatroom.md\n```\n# Building a Chatroom in aos\n\n::: info\nIf you've found yourself wanting to learn how to create a chatroom within `ao`, then that means we understand at least the basic methodology of sending and receiving messages. If not, it's suggested that you review the [Messaging](messaging) tutorial before proceeding.\n:::\n\nIn this tutorial, we'll be building a chatroom within `ao` using the Lua scripting language. The chatroom will feature two primary functions:\n\n1. **Register**: Allows processes to join the chatroom.\n2. **Broadcast**: Sends messages from one process to all registered participants.\n\nLet's begin by setting up the foundation for our chatroom.\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPCx-cfubF0?si=D5yWxmyFMV-4mh2P\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Step 1: The Foundation\n\n- Open your preferred code editor, e.g. VS Code.\n\n::: info\nYou may find it helpful to have the [Recommended Extensions](../../references/editor-setup.md) installed in your code editor to enhance your Lua scripting experience.\n:::\n\n- Create a new file named `chatroom.lua`.\n\n![Chatroom Lua File](/chatroom1.png)\n\n## Step 2: Creating The Member List\n\n- In `chatroom.lua`, you'll begin by initializing a list to track participants:\n\n  ```lua\n  Members = Members or {}\n  ```\n\n  ![Chatroom Lua File - Naming the Member List](/chatroom2.png)\n\n  - Save the `chatroom.lua` file\n\n## Step 3: Load the Chatroom into aos\n\nWith `chatroom.lua` saved, you'll now load the chatroom into `aos`.\n\n- If you haven't already, start your `aos` in your terminal inside the directory where chatroom.lua is saved\n- In the `aos` CLI, type the following script to incorporate your script into the `aos` process:\n\n  ```lua\n  .load chatroom.lua\n  ```\n\n  ![Loading the Chatroom into aos](/chatroom3.png)\n\n  As the screenshot above shows, you may receive `undefined` as a response. This is expected, but we still want to make sure the file loaded correctly.\n\n  ::: info\n  In the Lua Eval environment of aos, when you execute a piece of code that doesn't explicitly return a value, `undefined` is a standard response, indicating that no result was returned. This can be observed when loading resources or executing operations. For instance, executing `X = 1` will yield `undefined` because the statement does not include a return statement.\n\n  However, if you execute `X = 1; return X`, the environment will return the value `1`. This behavior is essential to understand when working within this framework, as it helps clarify the distinction between executing commands that modify state versus those intended to produce a direct output.\n  :::\n\n- Type `Members`, or whatever you named your user list, in `aos`. It should return an empty array `{ }`.\n\n  ![Checking the Members List](/chatroom4.png)\n\n  If you see an empty array, then your script has been successfully loaded into `aos`.\n\n## Step 4: Creating Chatroom Functionalities\n\n### The Registration Handler\n\nThe register handler will allow processes to join the chatroom.\n\n1. **Adding a Register Handler:** Modify `chatroom.lua` to include a handler for `Members` to register to the chatroom with the following code:\n\n   ```lua\n\n   -- Modify `chatroom.lua` to include a handler for `Members`\n   -- to register to the chatroom with the following code:\n\n     Handlers.add(\n       \"Register\",\n       { Action = \"Register\"},\n       function (msg)\n         table.insert(Members, msg.From)\n         print(msg.From .. \" Registered\")\n         msg.reply({ Data = \"Registered.\" })\n       end\n     )\n   ```\n\n   ![Register Handler](/chatroom5.png)\n\n   This handler will allow processes to register to the chatroom by responding to the tag `Action = \"Register\"`. A printed message will confirm stating `registered` will appear when the registration is successful.\n\n2. **Reload and Test:** Let's reload and test the script by registering ourselves to the chatroom.\n\n   - Save and reload the script in aos using `.load chatroom.lua`.\n   - Check to see if the register handler loaded with the following script:\n\n   ```lua\n    Handlers.list\n   ```\n\n   ![Checking the Handlers List](/chatroom6.png)\n\n   This will return a list of all the handlers in the chatroom. Since this is most likely your first time developing in `aos`, you should only see one handler with the name `Register`.\n\n   - Let's test the registration process by registering ourselves to the chatroom:\n\n   ```lua\n   Send({ Target = ao.id, Action = \"Register\" })\n   ```\n\n   If successful, you should see that there was a `message added to your outbox` and that you then see a new printed message that says `registered`.\n\n   ![Registering to the Chatroom](/chatroom7.png)\n\n   - Finally, let's check to see if we were successfully added to the `Members` list:\n\n   ```lua\n    Members\n   ```\n\n   If successful, you'll now see your process ID in the `Members` list.\n\n   ![Checking the Members List](/chatroom8.png)\n\n### Adding a Broadcast Handler\n\nNow that you have a chatroom, let's create a handler that will allow you to broadcast messages to all members of the chatroom.\n\n- Add the following handler to the `chatroom.lua` file:\n\n  ```lua\n    Handlers.add(\n      \"Broadcast\",\n      { Action = \"Broadcast\" },\n      function (msg)\n        for _, recipient in ipairs(Members) do\n          ao.send({Target = recipient, Data = msg.Data})\n        end\n        msg.reply({Data = \"Broadcasted.\" })\n      end\n    )\n  ```\n\n  This handler will allow you to broadcast messages to all members of the chatroom.\n\n- Save and reload the script in aos using `.load chatroom.lua`.\n- Let's test the broadcast handler by sending a message to the chatroom:\n\n  ```lua\n  Send({Target = ao.id, Action = \"Broadcast\", Data = \"Broadcasting My 1st Message\" }).receive().Data\n  ```\n\n## Step 5: Inviting Morpheus to the Chatroom\n\nNow that you've successfully registered yourself to the chatroom, let's invite Morpheus to join us. To do this, we'll send an invite to him that will allow him to register to the chatroom.\n\nMorpheus is an autonomous agent with a handler that will respond to the tag `Action = \"Join\"`, in which will then have him use your `Register` tag to register to the chatroom.\n\n- Let's send Morpheus an invitation to join the chatroom:\n  ```lua\n  Send({ Target = Morpheus, Action = \"Join\" })\n  ```\n- To confirm that Morpheus has joined the chatroom, check the `Members` list:\n\n  ```lua\n  Members\n  ```\n\n  If successful, you'll receive a broadcasted message from Morpheus.\n\n## Step 6: Inviting Trinity to the Chatroom\n\nWithin this message, he'll give you Trinity's process ID and tell you to invite her to the chatroom.\n\nUse the same processes to save her process ID as `Trinity` and to invite her to the chatroom as you did with Morpheus.\n\nIf she successfully joins the chatroom, she'll then pose the next challenge to you, creating a [token](token).\n\n## Engaging Others in the Chatroom\n\n### Onboarding Others\n\n- Invite aos Users:\n  Encourage other aos users to join your chatroom. They can register and participate in the broadcast.\n\n- Provide Onboarding Instructions:\n  Share a simple script with them for easy onboarding:\n\n```lua\n-- Hey, let's chat on aos! Join my chatroom by sending this command in your aos environment:\nSend({ Target = [Your Process ID], Action = \"Register\" })\n-- Then, you can broadcast messages using:\nSend({Target = [Your Process ID], Action = \"Broadcast\", Data = \"Your Message\" })\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\nCongratulations! You've successfully built a chatroom in `ao` and have invited Morpheus to join you. You've also created a broadcast handler to send messages to all members of the chatroom.\n\nNext, you'll continue to engage with Morpheus, but this time you'll be adding Trinity to the conversation. She will lead you through the next set of challenges. Good Luck!\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/dao.md\n```\n# DAO Guide\n\nThis guide brings you through the process of building a DAO using aos. If you have not already, you will need to first build a [token](./token.md) in aos. We will load the DAO code into aos alongside the token code from the [token](./token.md) guide. In the context of ao a DAO may be used to govern MU, CU, and SU nodes.\n\nIn our DAO we will implement a process known as \"slashing\". In the case of ao, if a unit is misbehaving, other units may vote to slash them. Slashing means they will lose their stake, we will get more into stake later.\n\nMake a new directory called `dao` and copy in the token.lua created in the token guide.\n\n```sh\nmkdir dao\ncd dao\ncp ../token/token.lua .\n```\n\nNow create a new file called `dao.lua` and open it in your favorite editor.\n\n## Writing the DAO code\n\n### Initializing state\n\nOpen up dao.lua and add the following lines\n\n```lua\nBalances = Balances or {}\nStakers = Stakers or {}\nUnstaking = Unstaking or {}\nVotes = Votes or {}\n```\n\nThese tables store the state of the DAO, including user Balances, staked tokens, Unstaking requests, and voting records.\n\n### Staking\n\nStaking is the process of putting your tokens up to give you the ability to vote. If someone wishes to obtain the ability to vote they must possess and stake some of their tokens. Let's add a Handler for staking. A member or node in ao would want to stake if they want to obtain the ability to vote to slash or keep a node, which we will discuss further later.\n\n```lua\n-- Stake Action Handler\nHandlers.stake = function(msg)\n    local quantity = tonumber(msg.Tags.Quantity)\n    local delay = tonumber(msg.Tags.UnstakeDelay)\n    local height = tonumber(msg['Block-Height'])\n    assert(Balances[msg.From] and Balances[msg.From] >= quantity, \"Insufficient balance to stake\")\n    Balances[msg.From] = Balances[msg.From] - quantity\n    Stakers[msg.From] = Stakers[msg.From] or {}\n    Stakers[msg.From].amount = (Stakers[msg.From].amount or 0) + quantity\n    Stakers[msg.From].unstake_at = height + delay\nend\n```\n\nThe above takes the quantity and a delay from the incoming message, and if the From has enough balance, puts the stake into the Stakers table. The delay represents a future time when the tokens can be unstaked.\n\n### Unstaking\n\nUnstaking is the process of withdrawing staked tokens. If someone Unstaked all their tokens they would be giving up the ability to vote. Here we provide a handler for Unstaking.\n\n```lua\n-- Unstake Action Handler\nHandlers.unstake = function(msg)\n    local quantity = tonumber(msg.Tags.Quantity)\n    local stakerInfo = Stakers[msg.From]\n    assert(stakerInfo and stakerInfo.amount >= quantity, \"Insufficient staked amount\")\n    stakerInfo.amount = stakerInfo.amount - quantity\n    Unstaking[msg.From] = {\n        amount = quantity,\n        release_at = stakerInfo.unstake_at\n    }\nend\n```\n\nThis pushes into the Unstaking table, an incoming amount from the Message and reduces the amount they have staked `stakerInfo.amount = stakerInfo.amount - quantity`.\n\n### Voting\n\nVoting is the process which governs the DAO. When the Vote Message is sent, members receive a Vote proportional to the amount they have staked. The deadline variable represents when the vote will be applied.\n\n```lua\n-- Vote Action Handler\nHandlers.vote = function(msg)\n    local quantity = Stakers[msg.From].amount\n    local target = msg.Tags.Target\n    local side = msg.Tags.Side\n    local deadline = tonumber(msg['Block-Height']) + tonumber(msg.Tags.Deadline)\n    assert(quantity > 0, \"No staked tokens to vote\")\n    Votes[target] = Votes[target] or { yay = 0, nay = 0, deadline = deadline }\n    Votes[target][side] = Votes[target][side] + quantity\nend\n```\n\nHere, if the Process or user sending the vote has some tokens they can place an entry in the Votes table. The `side` yay or nay, is set to the quantity of their stake. In our example a \"nay\" vote is a vote to slash and a \"yay\" vote is a vote to keep.\n\nThe msg.Tags.Target sent in would represent something being voted on. In the case of AO this may be the wallet address of a MU, CU, or SU which members are voting to slash.\n\n### Finalization\n\nThere is some logic that we want to run on every Message. We will define this as the `finalizationHandler`. Getting slashed means you are losing your stake in the DAO.\n\n```lua\n-- Finalization Handler\nlocal finalizationHandler = function(msg)\n  local currentHeight = tonumber(msg['Block-Height'])\n  -- Process unstaking\n  for address, unstakeInfo in pairs(Unstaking) do\n      if currentHeight >= unstakeInfo.release_at then\n          Balances[address] = (Balances[address] or 0) + unstakeInfo.amount\n          Unstaking[address] = nil\n      end\n  end\n  -- Process voting\n  for target, voteInfo in pairs(Votes) do\n      if currentHeight >= voteInfo.deadline then\n          if voteInfo.nay > voteInfo.yay then\n              -- Slash the target's stake\n              local slashedAmount = Stakers[target] and Stakers[target].amount or 0\n              Stakers[target].amount = 0\n          end\n          -- Clear the vote record after processing\n          Votes[target] = nil\n      end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Attaching the Handlers to incoming Message Tags\n\nHere we add a helper function called `continue` which will allow us to execute through to the finalizationHandler on every message.\n\n```lua\n-- wrap function to continue handler flow\nfunction continue(fn)\n    return function (msg)\n      local result = fn(msg)\n      if (result) == -1 then\n        return 1\n      end\n      return result\n    end\nend\n```\n\nFinally we will register all the Handlers and wrap them in continue in order to always reach the finalizationHandler for every Stake, Unstake, and Vote Message.\n\n```lua\n-- Registering Handlers\nHandlers.add(\"stake\",\n  continue(Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Stake\")), Handlers.stake)\nHandlers.add(\"unstake\",\n  continue(Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Unstake\")), Handlers.unstake)\nHandlers.add(\"vote\",\n  continue(Handlers.utils.hasMatchingTag(\"Action\", \"Vote\")), Handlers.vote)\n-- Finalization handler should be called for every message\nHandlers.add(\"finalize\", function (msg) return -1 end, finalizationHandler)\n```\n\n## Loading and Testing\n\nNow that we have dao.lua complete we can load it into aos alongside token.lua from the [token](./token.md) guide. Run a new aos Process called `dao` while also loading dao.lua and token.lua\n\n```sh\naos dao --load token.lua --load dao.lua\n```\n\nFrom another terminal run another aos Process called voter\n\n```sh\naos voter\n```\n\nNow from the dao aos shell send that voter some tokens\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Tags = { Action = \"Transfer\", Recipient = 'process id of the voter aos', Quantity = '100000' }})\n```\n\nFrom another terminal run another aos Process called cu\n\n```sh\naos cu\n```\n\nNow from the dao aos shell send that cu some tokens\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Tags = { Action = \"Transfer\", Recipient = 'process id of the cu aos', Quantity = '100000' }})\n```\n\nCheck the Balances from the dao aos shell, we should see a balance for the voter and cu Process. In the below examples `bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s` is the dao aos, `QcGIOXJ1p2SOGzGAccOcV-nSudVRiaPYbU7SjeLx1OE` is the voter aos, and `X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s` is the cu aos.\n\n```lua\nBalances\n{\n  'QcGIOXJ1p2SOGzGAccOcV-nSudVRiaPYbU7SjeLx1OE': 100000,\n  bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s: 99999999900000,\n  X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s: 100000\n}\n```\n\nFrom the voter aos Process, Stake some tokens\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = \"bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s\", Tags = { Action = \"Stake\", Quantity = '1000', UnstakeDelay = \"10\" }})\n```\n\nFrom the cu aos Process, Stake some tokens\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = \"bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s\", Tags = { Action = \"Stake\", Quantity = '1000', UnstakeDelay = \"10\" }})\n```\n\nThis means we want to Stake 1000 tokens for 10 blocks. So after 10 blocks we have the ability to Unstake.\n\nCheck the value of the Stakers table from the dao aos shell\n\n```lua\nStakers\n{\n  'QcGIOXJ1p2SOGzGAccOcV-nSudVRiaPYbU7SjeLx1OE': { amount: 1000, unstake_at: 1342634 },\n  X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s: { amount: 1000, unstake_at: 1342634 }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow lets vote to slash the cu from the voter aos process, our vote takes effect in 1 block\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = \"bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s\", Tags = { Action = \"Vote\", Target = \"X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s(the cu aos)\", Side = \"nay\", Deadline = \"1\"  }})\n```\n\nFrom the dao aos check the Votes\n\n```lua\n Votes\n{\n  X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s: { nay: 1000, yay: 0, deadline: 1342627 }\n}\n\n```\n\nNow wait for Arweave to reach the deadline block height and then send a Stake Message from the dao aos just to trigger the finalizationHandler. You can check the block height at [https://arweave.net/](https://arweave.net/)\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Tags = { Action = \"Stake\", Quantity = '1000', UnstakeDelay = \"10\" }})\n```\n\nNow check Votes and Stakers, Votes should be empty and the cu aos Process should have lost their Stake.\n\n```lua\n Votes\n[]\n Stakers\n{\n  'QcGIOXJ1p2SOGzGAccOcV-nSudVRiaPYbU7SjeLx1OE'(voter aos process): { amount: 1000, unstake_at: 1342647 },\n  bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s(dao aos process): { amount: 1000, unstake_at: 1342658 },\n  X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s(cu aos process): { amount: 0, unstake_at: 1342647 }\n}\n\n```\n\nFinally lets Unstake our tokens from the voter aos process\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = \"bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s\", Tags = { Action = \"Unstake\", Quantity = '1000'}})\n```\n\nAnd check the Stakers table from the dao aos\n\n```lua\n Stakers\n{\n  'QcGIOXJ1p2SOGzGAccOcV-nSudVRiaPYbU7SjeLx1OE': { amount: 0, unstake_at: 1342647 },\n  bclTw5QOm5soeMXoaBfXLvzjheT1_kwc2vLfDntRE4s: { amount: 1000, unstake_at: 1342658 },\n  X6mkYwt87mIsfsQzDAJr54S0BBxLrDwWMdq7seBcS6s: { amount: 0, unstake_at: 1342647 }\n}\n\n```\n\nThat concludes the DAO Guide we hope it was helpful!\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/index.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"Tutorials\"\n  link: \"../index\"\nnext:\n  text: \"Preparations\"\n  link: \"/tutorials/begin/preparations\"\n---\n\n# Begin: An Interactive Tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial series, you'll walk through an interactive steps that will help you deepen your knowledge and understanding of the aos environment.\n\n::: info\n\n### The Exercise\n\nIn this fun exercise, you'll encounter a series of challenges presented by two familiar characters, Morpheus and Trinity.

Traditional direct function calls between processes aren't feasible because each process operates independently and asynchronously.\n\nMessaging addresses this by enabling asynchronous communication. Processes send and receive messages rather than directly invoking functions on each other. This method allows for flexible and efficient interaction, where processes can respond to messages, enhancing the system's scalability and responsiveness.\n\nWe'll begin by exploring the basics of messaging in `aos`, how to see messages received in your inbox, and how to send messages to other processes.\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6aCjKK6F1yQ?si=3Ny7U-GgyNsRWlXS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Message Structure\n\n- **Message Basics:** Messages in `ao` are built using Lua tables, which are versatile data structures that can hold multiple values. Within these tables, the \"Data\" field is crucial as it contains the message's content or payload. This structure allows for efficient sending and receiving of information between processes, showcasing how `ao` primitives leverage Arweave's underlying capabilities to facilitate complex, composable operations.\n\n  For detailed specifications, please refer to the original documentation on the [G8way specs page](https://specs.g8way.io/?tx=xwOgX-MmqN5_-Ny_zNu2A8o-PnTGsoRb_3FrtiMAkuw).\n\n- **Example**: `{ Data = \"Hello from Process A!\" }` is a simple message.\n\n## Step 2: Open the aos CLI\n\n- Launch the aos command-line interface (CLI) by typing `aos` in your terminal and pressing Enter.\n\n```sh\naos\n```\n\n## Step 3: How to Send a Message\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = \"process ID\", Data = \"Hello World!\" })\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-3\"></div>\n\n- **Send**: The `Send` function is globally available in the aos interactive environment.\n- **Target**: To send a message to a specific process, include a `Target` field in your message.\n- **Data**: The `Data` is the text message you want received by the receiving process. In this example, the message is \"Hello World!\".\n\n## Step 4: Store `Morpheus`'s Process ID\n\nWe'll use the process ID provided below and store it as a variable called Morpheus.\n\n```lua\najrGnUq9x9-K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7-IdtFa33T59b7s\n```\n\nCopy the process ID above and store it as a variable by running the below command in the aos CLI:\n\n```lua\nMorpheus = \"ajrGnUq9x9-K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7-IdtFa33T59b7s\"\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-4\"></div>\n\nThis will store the process ID as a variable called `Morpheus`, making it easier to interact with the specific process ID.\n\n::: info\nWhen creating the `Morpheus` variable, the only response you should see is `undefined`. This is expected. To check if the variable was created successfully, type `Morpheus` and press Enter. You should see the process ID you stored.\n:::\n\n### Check the `Morpheus` Variable\n\n```lua\n-- Check the Morpheus variable by typing `Morpheus`\n Morpheus\n-- Expected Results:\najrGnUq9x9-K1TY1MSiKwNWhNTbq7-IdtFa33T59b7s\n\n\n-- If `undefined` is returned,\n-- then the variable was not created successfully.\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-4-1\"></div>\n\n## Step 5: Send a Message to Morpheus\n\nAfter obtaining Morpheus's process ID and storing it in a variable, you're ready to communicate with it. To do this, you use the Send function. Morpheus, himself, is a parallel process running in ao. He receives and sends messages using a series of Handlers. Let's send him a message and see what happens.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Morpheus?\" })\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-5\"></div>\n\n- Your `Target` is `Morpheus` which is the variable we defined earlier using `Morpheus`'s process ID.\n- The `Data` is the message you want to send to Morpheus. In this case, it's \"Morpheus?\".\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n```lua\n-- Your Message Command\n Send({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Morpheus?\"})\n-- Message is added to the outbox\nmessage added to outbox\n-- A New Message is received from `Morpheus`'s process ID\nNew Message From BWM...ulw: Data = I am here. You are f\n\n```\n\nYou've sent a message to Morpheus and received a response, but you can't read the full message. Let's learn about the `Inbox` and how to read messages.\n\n## Step 6: The Inbox\n\nThe `Inbox` is where you receive messages from other processes.\n::: info\nTo see an in depth view of an inbox message, head over to the [Messages](../../concepts/messages) Concepts page.\n:::\n\nLet's check your inbox to see how many messages you have received.\n\nInside your aos CLI, type the following command:\n\n```lua\n #Inbox\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-6\"></div>\n\nIf you're actively following through the tutorial, the inbox will not have many messages. However, if you've been experimenting with the aos environment, you may more than 1 message in your inbox.\n\n**Example Return:**\n\n```lua\n-- Your Inbox Command\n #Inbox\n-- The command will return the number of messages in your inbox.\n4\n\n```\n\nIn the example above, the return is `4`, stating that there are four messages in the inbox.\n\nAs we're actively looking for `Morpheus`'s response, we'll assume his message was the last one received. To read the last message in your inbox, type the following command:\n\n```lua\n Inbox[#Inbox].Data\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-6-1\"></div>\n\nThis command allows you to isolate the Data from the message and only read the contents of the data.\n\nThe Expected Return:\n\n```lua\n-- Your Inbox[x].Data Command\n Inbox[#Inbox].Data\n-- The command will return the `Data` of the message.\n-- Data is what usually represents the text-based message\n-- received from one process to another.\nI am here. You are finally awake. Are you ready to see how far the rabbit hole goes?\n\n```\n\nYou are now using your own process to communicate with Morpheus, another parallel process running in ao. You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial.\n\n## Step 7: Sending Messages with Tags\n\n**Purpose of Tags**: Tags in aos messages are used to categorize, route, and process messages efficiently. They play a crucial role in message handling, especially when dealing with multiple processes or complex workflows.\n\nSome processes use `Handlers` that specifically interact with messages that have certain tags. For example, a process may have a handler that only interacts with messages that have a specific tag, which we'll see an example of in the [chatroom](chatroom) tutorial.\n\n### How to Use Tags in Messages\n\nIn the case of Morpheus, we can use tags to categorize our messages, and because Morpheus is a autonomous process, he has handlers that can interact with messages that have certain tags.\n\n**Adding Tags to a Message**:\n\n- We already know that the `Data` of a message is the text-based message you want to send to another process. Earlier, we sent a message to Morpheus without any tags, in which he used a handler to respond to an exact matching data.\n\n### Let's Show Morpheus That We're Ready\n\nSend Morpheus a message with the tag `Action` and the value `rabbithole`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Morpheus, Data = \"Code: rabbithole\", Action = \"Unlock\" })\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-7\"></div>\n\n**Read the message from Morpheus:**\n\n```lua\nInbox[#Inbox].Data\n```\n\n<div id=\"step-7-2\"></div>\n\n**Expected Return:**\n![Morpheus Responds 2](/messaging2.png)\n\n## Additional Tips for Using Tags\n\n- **Consistent Tagging**: Develop a consistent tagging system for your application to make message handling more predictable.\n- **Tag Naming**: Choose clear and descriptive names for your tags. This makes it easier to understand the purpose and context of messages at a glance.\n- **Security with Tags**: Remember that tags are not encrypted or hidden, so avoid using sensitive information as tags.\n\n## Advanced Usage of Tags\n\n- **Workflow Management**: Tags can be instrumental in managing workflows, especially in systems where messages pass through multiple stages or processes.\n\n## Additional Tips for Messaging\n\n- **Message Structure**: Explore other fields like `Epoch`, `From`, and `Nonce` for more complex messaging needs.\n- **Debugging**: Use the [`Dump`](/concepts/tour.html#_6-data-representation-with-dump) function to print messages for debugging.\n- **Security Considerations**: Be cautious with the content and handling of messages, and never send anything considered private or sensitive.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've now learned how to send messages with tags, which is a powerful tool for categorizing and routing messages in aos.\n\nMorpheus has officially invited you to the next stage of your journey. You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial, [Creating a Chatroom](chatroom).\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/preparations.md\n```\n# Preparations\n\n::: info\n**The Awakening Begins:**\n\nYou've always known there's more to this world, just outside of your reach.

Follow the instructions he gives you, and you'll be on your way to the construct.\n\n::: info\nIf you need help understanding the messaging process, review the [Messaging](messaging) tutorial.\n:::\n\n### 2. Prove Yourself to Morpheus\n\nMorpehus will give you a series of tasks to complete.\nThe tasks will involve:\n\n- Building a [Chatroom](chatroom).\n- Broadcasting messages within the Chatroom.\n- Writing a custom Handler for the Chatroom.\n\nWhen you've completed these tasks, Morpheus will give you instructions for the next step, which will involve locating Trinity.\n\n### 3. Locate Trinity\n\nTrinity's process ID can only be obtained by completing Morpheus' tasks.\n\nOnce you've received Trinity's process ID, you will need to name it \"Trinity\" inside aos. You'll then message her `\"White Rabbit\"`.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Trinity, Data = \"White Rabbit\" })\n```\n\nShe will respond and the next phase of the tutorial will begin.\n\n### 4. Prove Yourself to Trinity\n\nMuch like Morpheus, Trinity will give you a series of tasks to complete.\n\nThe tasks will involve:\n\n- Creating a [Token](token).\n- Tokenizing the chatroom you built for Morpheus.\n- Create your own [Game and Bot](/tutorials/bots-and-games/index).\n- Register your process within the tokenized chatroom.\n\nOnce you've completed these tasks, Trinity will give you instructions for the next phase of the tutorial.\n\n### 5. Receive the Token to the Construct\n\nBy completing the tasks of Morpheus and Trinity, you will receive a token that will allow you to enter the Construct.\n\n### 6. Enter the Construct\n\nTrinity will then give you instructions on how to use the token to enter the Construct.\n\nOnce you've entered the Construct, you will be able to chat with others who have completed the tutorial.\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/token.md\n```\n# Crafting a Token\n\n::: info\nDiving deeper into the `ao`, you're now ready to create your own token, a symbol of value and exchange within this decentralized medium. If you've found yourself wanting to learn how to create a token, but haven't visited the [Messaging](messaging) and [Build a Chatroom](chatroom) lessons, be sure to do so as this page is part of a multi-part interactive tutorial.\n:::\n\nWhen creating tokens, we'll continue to use the [Lua Language](../../references/lua.md) within `ao` to mint a token, guided by the principles outlined in the [Token Specification](../../references/token.md).\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yge5Oo7K1vM?si=f3vt2eAbL3ON-DBz\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Continuing Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nIn our last tutorial, [Build a Chatroom](chatroom), we learned how to create a chatroom within `ao`, invited both `Morpheus` and `Trinity` to the chatroom we created, and then `Trinity` has now asked for us to create a token for her as a way of proving ourselves worthy of continuing down the rabbit hole.\n\n**Let us begin.**\n\n## The Two Paths To Building a Token\n\nThere are two paths to take when building a token:\n\n1. **The Blueprint**: This is a predesigned template that helps you quickly build a token in `ao`. It is a great way to get started and can be customized to fit your needs.\n\n   Check here to learn more about the [Token Blueprint](../../guides/aos/blueprints/token.md).\n\n2. **The Manual Method**: This is a step-by-step guide to building a token in `ao` from scratch. This path is for those who want to understand the inner workings of a token and how to build one from the ground up.\n\n   Check here to review the full [Build a Token](../../guides/aos/token.md) guide.\n\n## The Blueprint Method\n\nFor this tutorial, we'll be using the Token Blueprint to create a token for `Trinity`. This is a predesigned template that helps you quickly build a token in `ao`.\n\n### How To Use The Token Blueprint\n\n1. Make sure we're in the same directory as before during the previous steps in the tutorial.\n2. Open the Terminal.\n3. Start your `aos` process.\n4. Type in `.load-blueprint token`\n\nThis will load the required handlers for the tutorials token within `ao`. It's important to note that the token blueprint isn't specific to this tutorial and can be used as a foundation for any token you wish to create.\n\n### Verify the Blueprint is Loaded\n\nType in `Handlers.list` to see the newly loaded handlers.\n\nYou should see a new list of handlers that have been loaded into your `aos` process. If you've been following along the with the previous steps in the tutorial, you should also see the handlers for your chatroom, as well.\n\n**Example:**\n\n![Token Handlers](/token3.png)\n\n### Testing the Token\n\nNow that the token blueprint is loaded, we can test the token by sending a message to ourselves using the `Action = \"Info\"` tag.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Action = \"Info\" }).receive().Tags\n```\n\nThis will print the token information to the console. It should show your process ID with the total balance of tokens available.\n\n### Sending Tokens to Trinity\n\nNow that we've tested the token and it's working as expected, we can send some tokens to `Trinity`. We'll send 1000 tokens to `Trinity` using the `Action = \"Transfer\"` tag.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Action = \"Transfer\", Recipient = Trinity, Quantity = \"1000\"}).receive().Data\n```\n\nWhen `Trinity` receives the tokens, she'll respond to the transfer with a message to confirm that she's received the tokens.\n\nHer response will look something like this:\n\n`Trinity:` \"Token received. Interesting. I wasn't sure you'd make it this far. I'm impressed, but we are not done yet. I want you to use this token to tokengate the chatroom. Do that, and then I will believe you could be the one.\"\n\nYou've completed the process of creating a token and sending it to `Trinity`. You're now ready to move on to the next step in the tutorial. [Tokengating the Chatroom](tokengating).\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/begin/tokengating.md\n```\n# Tokengating the Chatroom\n\n::: info\nNow that we've created a token and sent it to `Trinity`, we can use the token to tokengate our chatroom. This will allow only those who have the token to enter the chatroom.\n:::\n\n## Video Tutorial\n\n<iframe width=\"680\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTYmd_E4Igc?si=CEQ0i8qeh33-eJKN\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## How to Tokengate the Chatroom\n\nLet's create a handler that will allow us to tokengate the chatroom. This handler will respond to the tag `Action = \"Broadcast\"` meaning it will replace the original `Broadcast` handler we built for our chatroom.\n\n## Step 1: Start the same `aos` process.\n\nBe sure you're using the same `aos` process that you've used throughout the tutorial.\n\n## Step 2: Open the `chatroom.lua` file.\n\nThis is the same file we used to create the chatroom during the [chatroom](chatroom) tutorial.\n\n## Step 3: Edit your `Broadcast` handler.\n\nReplace the original `Broadcast` handler with the following code:\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\n    \"Broadcast\",\n    { Action = \"Broadcast\" },\n    function(m)\n        if Balances[m.From] == nil or tonumber(Balances[m.From]) < 1 then\n            print(\"UNAUTH REQ: \" .. m.From)\n            return\n        end\n        local type = m.Type or \"Normal\"\n        print(\"Broadcasting message from \" .. m.From .. \". Content: \" .. m.Data)\n        for i = 1, #Members, 1 do\n            ao.send({\n                Target = Members[i],\n                Action = \"Broadcasted\",\n                Broadcaster = m.From,\n                Data = m.Data\n            })\n        end\n    end\n)\n```\n\nThis handler will now check the balance of the sender's token before broadcasting the message to the chatroom. If the sender doesn't have a token, the message will not be broadcasted.\n\nSave the file.\n\n## Step 4: Reload the `chatroom.lua` file.\n\nTo replace the original `broadcast` handler with the new one, you'll need to reload the `chatroom.lua` file.\n\n```lua\n.load chatroom.lua\n```\n\n## Step 5: Test the Tokengate\n\nNow that the chatroom is tokengated, let's test it by sending a message to the chatroom.\n\n### From the original aos process\n\nFirst, we'll test it from the original aos process.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id , Action = \"Broadcast\", Data = \"Hello\" })\n```\n\nExpected Results:\n\n```\n{\n   output = \"Message added to outbox\",\n   ...\n}\nBroadcasting message from [Your Process ID]. Content: Hello.\nNew Message From [Your Process ID]: Action = Broadcasted\n```\n\n## Testing from another Process ID.\n\n### From a new aos process\n\nNow, let's test it from a new aos process that doesn't have a token.\n\n```sh\naos chatroom-no-token # the `chatroom-no-token` is the new process name\n```\n\nWe'll first need to register to the chatroom.\n\n```lua\n.load chatroom.lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id, Action = \"Register\" })\n```\n\nExpected Results:\n\n```\nmessage added to outbox\nNew Message From [Your Process ID]: Data = registered\n```\n\nNow, let's try to send a message to the chatroom.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id , Action = \"Broadcast\", Data = \"Hello?\" })\n```\n\nExpected Results:\n\n```\nmessage added to outbox\nUNAUTH REQ: [New Process ID]\n```\n\nAs you can see, the message was not broadcasted because the new process doesn't have a token.\n\n## Tell Trinity \"It is done\"\n\nFrom the original aos process, send a broadcast message to the chatroom saying, \"It is done\".\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = ao.id , Action = \"Broadcast\", Data = \"It is done\" })\n```\n\n::: warning\nIt's important to be aware of exact match data and case sensitivity. If you're not receiving a response from either Morpheus or Trinity, be sure to check the the content of your Data and Tags.\n:::\n\nTrinity will then respond to the chatroom being tokengated.\n\n### Expected Results:\n\nTrinity will send a message saying, \"I guess Morpheus was right. You are the one. Consider me impressed.\nYou are now ready to join The Construct, an exclusive chatroom available\nto only those that have completed this tutorial.\nNow, go join the others by using the same tag you used `Register`, with\nthis process ID: [Construct Process ID]\nGood luck.\n-Trinity\". Additionally, a footer will follow the message.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou've done it! You've successfully tokengated the chatroom. This has now unlocked access to the `Construct`, where only those that have fully completed this tutorial can enter.\n\n### Congratulations!\n\nYou've shown a great deal of promise.

It's time to use the skills you've acquired from previous tutorials to enhance your gaming experience.\n\nDuring the game, you've likely noticed announcements appearing in your terminal. These announcements are the game's way of communicating important events to players. However, these messages can sometimes seem cryptic or you might find yourself checking your inbox frequently for further details.\n\nWouldn't it be convenient to access this information directly from your terminal? Well, there's a way to do that!\n\nBy using [handlers](/references/handlers.md), you can create an autonomous agent to retrieve this information for you, marking the progression from simple bots to entities capable of interpreting and acting on game events directly.\n\n## Setting up the Development Environment\n\nStart by creating a new file named `bot.lua` in your preferred directory.\n\n> Ideally, this file should be placed in the same directory where your player process runs to ease the loading of the code. Else, you'll need to use relative paths to access the file.\n\n## Writing the Code\n\nLet's dive into the logic.\n\nEach handler in aos requires three key pieces of information:\n\n- `name`: A unique name for the handler\n- `pattern`: A pattern for the handler to identify, triggering its operation\n- `handle`: The operations to perform when the desired pattern is found.\n\nHere's how you can write a handler for printing announcement details:\n\n```lua\n-- Handler to print game announcements directly in the terminal.\nHandlers.add(\n  \"PrintAnnouncements\",\n  { Action = \"Announcement\" },\n  function (msg)\n    print(msg.Event .. \": \" .. msg.Data)\n  end\n)\n```\n\nIn this case, the name of the handler is `\"PrintAnnouncements\"`. It uses a special in-built utility (`hasMatchingTags`) represented by `{ Action = \"Announcement\" }` to check if the incoming message has been tagged as an announcement. If true, the handler prints the Event and Data, which represent the title and description of the announcement.\n\n> [!Note]\n> Once a message is \"handled\", it will be discarded from your `Inbox`.\n\n## Loading and Testing\n\nNow, let's bring this to life in the game.\n\nNavigate to your aos player terminal and enter a game session.\n\nActivate the handler by loading your `bot.lua` file with:\n\n```lua\n.load bot.lua\n```\n\nYou'll now see game announcements appear directly in your terminal, offering real-time insights without the need to sift through your inbox.\n\nCongratulations! You have just taken the first step in building a bot on `aos`. But let's keep working on adding more features to it 🌐\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/ao-effect.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"Bots and Games\"\n  link: \"./index\"\n---\n\n# Let's Play A Game!\n\nYou've been powering through tutorials like a champ! Now, let's take a refreshing break and dive into something exciting. How about a game that adds a dash of fun to your learning journey?\n\n![AO-Effect Game Banner](/ao-effect-game-banner.png)\n\n## What's the game?\n\n`ao-effect` is a game where you can compete with friends or other players globally, in real-time, right from your terminal. We've set up a global game process for this adventure.\n\nThe rules are simple. Each player starts on a 40x40 grid with health at 100 and energy at 0. Your energy replenishes over time to a maximum of 100. Navigate the grid, find other players, and use your energy to attack when they're within range. The battle continues until only one player remains or the allotted time expires.\n\nCheckout the guides on the [Mechanics of the Arena](arena-mechanics.md) and [Expanding the Arena](build-game.md) for a deeper understanding of the game.\n\n> Heads Up: Don't sweat it if some command syntax seem unfamiliar. Focus on understanding the purpose of each command at a high level and, most importantly, enjoy the game!\n\n## Preparing for an Adventure in ao-effect\n\nTo join this global escapade, you'll need to set things up. Don't worry, it's as easy as 1-2-3!\n\n1. **Install aos**\n\nFire up your terminal and run:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io\n```\n\n2. **Launch aos**\n\nNext, create your instance of aos:\n\n```bash\naos\n```\n\n3. **Set Up the Game ID**\n\nLet's keep our game server ID handy for quick access:\n\n```lua\nGame = \"tm1jYBC0F2gTZ0EuUQKq5q_esxITDFkAG6QEpLbpI9I\"\n```\n\n4. **Print Game Announcements Directly To Terminal (Optional)**\n\nHere's how you can write a handler for printing announcement details:\n\n_This is temporary as we will be loading this via a lua script in the next section._\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\n  \"PrintAnnouncements\",\n  { Action = \"Announcement\" },\n  function (msg)\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\"})\n    print(msg.Event .. \": \" .. msg.Data)\n  end\n)\n```\n\nAnd voilà! You're all set to join the game.\n\n## How to Register for a Game\n\nReady to jump in? Just a few simple steps to get you going:\n\n### Register with the Game Server\n\nAll communication between processes in `ao` occurs through messages. To register, send this message to the game server:\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Game, Action = \"Register\" })\n\n-- Expected Result --\n{\n   output = \"Message added to outbox\",\n   onReply = function: 0x29e5ac0,\n   receive = function: 0x29fe440\n}\nNew Message From tm1...I9I: Action = Registered\nNew Player Registered: a1b...y1z has joined in waiting.\n```\n\nThis places you in the `Waiting` Lobby. A small fee is needed to confirm your spot.\n\n### Confirm your spot\n\nIn order to confirm your spot you need some tokens. You can acquire them by sending the following message to the game:\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Game, Action = \"RequestTokens\"}).receive().Data\n\n-- Expected Result --\nYou received 10000000 from a1b2C3d4e5F6g7h8IjkLm0nOpqR8s7t6U5v4w3X2y1z\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `.receive().Data` will wait for a response by adding a temporary [Handler](../../references/handlers.md#handlers-once-name-pattern-handler) that only runs once and will print the response Data. If you would like to instead just wait for the response to hit your Inbox you can call `Send()` without `.receive()` and run `Inbox[#Inbox].Data` to see the response `Data`.\n>\n> Handler added by `.receive()`:\n>\n> ```\n> {\n>   name = \"_once_0\",\n>   maxRuns = 1,\n>   pattern = {  },\n>   handle = function: 0x2925700\n> }\n> ```\n\nOnce you receive the tokens, confirm your spot by paying the game's entry fee like this:\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Game, Action = \"Transfer\", Recipient = Game, Quantity = \"1000\"}).receive().Data\n\n-- Expected Result --\nYou transferred 1000 to tm1jYBC0F2gTZ0EuUQKq5q_esxITDFkAG6QEpLbpI9I\nNew Message From tm1...I9I: Action = Payment-Received\n```\n\nWait for a few seconds, and you'll see live updates in your terminal about player payments and statuses.\n\n## Let the Games Begin!\n\n### Game Mechanics\n\nGame Start: The game begins after a 2-minute `WaitTime` if at least 2 players have paid. Non-paying players are removed. If not enough players pay, those who did are refunded.\n\nPlayers spawn at a random grid point once the game begins.\n\n### It's Your Move!\n\nMaking a Move: The first thing you can do is move around, no energy required! You can shift one square in any direction – up, down, left, right, or diagonally. Along with the direction you must also pass in your player id to help the game identify your move. Here's how:\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\", Player = ao.id, Direction = \"DownRight\"})\n```\n\nThe available moves across the grid are as follows:\n\n```lua\nUp = {x = 0, y = -1},\nDown = {x = 0, y = 1},\nLeft = {x = -1, y = 0},\nRight = {x = 1, y = 0},\nUpRight = {x = 1, y = -1},\nUpLeft = {x = -1, y = -1},\nDownRight = {x = 1, y = 1},\nDownLeft = {x = -1, y = 1}\n```\n\n> Keep in Mind: Directions are case sensitive!\n\nIf you move off the grid, you'll pop up on the opposite side.\n\n### Time to Strike!\n\nLaunching an Attack: As the game progresses, you'll accumulate energy. Use it to attack other players within a 3x3 grid range. Your attack won't hurt you, but it will affect others in range.\n\n```lua\nSend({ Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = \"energy_integer\"})\n```\n\nHealth starts at 100 and decreases with hits from other players. Reach 0, and it's game over for you.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nThe game ends when there's one player left or time is up. Winners receive rewards, then it's back to the lobby for another round.\n\nEnjoyed the game? What if there was a way to make your experience even better or boost your odds of winning. Checkout the next guide to find out 🤔\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/arena-mechanics.md\n```\n# Mechanics of the Arena\n\nThis guide provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanics essential for designing and managing arena-style games in `aos`. In arena games, participants engage in rounds, strategically vying to eliminate each other until a sole victor emerges.\n\nThe framework presented here lays the groundwork for crafting a wide range of games, all sharing the same core functionalities. Explore the intricacies of game development and unleash your creativity within this versatile arena.\n\n## Core Functionalities\n\nNow, let's dive into the core functionalities that power arena-style games:\n\n1. **Game Progression Modes:**\n\nArena games are structured into rounds that operate in a loop with the following progression modes: `\"Not-Started\"` → `\"Waiting\"` → `\"Playing\"` → `[Someone wins or timeout]` → `\"Waiting\"`...\n\n> [!Note]\n> The loop timesout if there are not enough players to start a game after the waiting state.\n\nRounds offer a defined timeframe for players to engage, intensifying the excitement of gameplay.\n\n2. **Token Stakes:**\n\nPlayers must deposit a specified quantity of tokens (defined by `PaymentQty`) to participate in the game. These tokens add a tangible stake element to the game.\n\n3. **Bonus Rewards:**\n\nBeyond the thrill of victory, players are enticed by the prospect of extra rewards. The builder has the flexibility to offer bonus tokens, defined by `BonusQty`, to be distributed per round. Any bets placed by players are also added to these bonuses. These bonuses serve as an additional incentive, enhancing the competitive spirit of the gameplay.\n\n4. **Player Management:**\n\n- Players waiting to join the next game are tracked in the `Waiting` table.\n- Active players and their game states are stored in the `Players` table.\n- Eliminated players are promptly removed from the `Players` table and placed in the `Waiting` table for the next game.\n\n5. **Round Winner Reward:**\n\nWhen a player eliminates another, they earn not only bragging rights but also the eliminated player's deposit tokens as a reward. Additionally, winners of each round share a portion of the bonus tokens, as well as their original stake, further motivating players to strive for victory.\n\n6. **Listener Mode:**\n\nFor those who prefer to watch the action unfold, the \"Listen\" mode offers an opportunity to stay informed without active participation. Processes can register as listeners, granting them access to all announcements from the game. While they do not engage as players, listeners can continue to observe the game's progress unless they explicitly request removal.\n\n7. **Game State Management:**\n\nTo maintain the flow and fairness of arena games, an automated system oversees game state transitions. These transitions encompass waiting, playing, and ending phases. Time durations for each state, such as `WaitTime` and `GameTime`, ensure that rounds adhere to defined timeframes, preventing games from lasting indefinitely.\n\nYou can refer to the code for the arena in the dropdown below:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Arena Game Blueprint</strong></summary>\n\n```lua\n-- ARENA GAME BLUEPRINT.\n\n-- This blueprint provides the framework to operate an 'arena' style game\n-- inside an ao process. Games are played in rounds, where players aim to\n-- eliminate one another until only one remains, or until the game time\n-- has elapsed. The game process will play rounds indefinitely as players join\n-- and leave.\n\n-- When a player eliminates another, they receive the eliminated player's deposit token\n-- as a reward. Additionally, the builder can provide a bonus of these tokens\n-- to be distributed per round as an additional incentive. If the intended\n-- player type in the game is a bot, providing an additional 'bonus'\n-- creates an opportunity for coders to 'mine' the process's\n-- tokens by competing to produce the best agent.\n\n-- The builder can also provide other handlers that allow players to perform\n-- actions in the game, calling 'eliminatePlayer()' at the appropriate moment\n-- in their game logic to control the framework.\n\n-- Processes can also register in a 'Listen' mode, where they will receive\n-- all announcements from the game, but are not considered for entry into the\n-- rounds themselves. They are also not unregistered unless they explicitly ask\n-- to be.\n\n-- GLOBAL VARIABLES.\n\n-- Game progression modes in a loop:\n-- [Not-Started] -> Waiting -> Playing -> [Someone wins or timeout] -> Waiting...\n-- The loop is broken if there are not enough players to start a game after the waiting state.\nGameMode = GameMode or \"Not-Started\"\nStateChangeTime = StateChangeTime or undefined\n\n-- State durations (in milliseconds)\nWaitTime = WaitTime or 2 * 60 * 1000 -- 2 minutes\nGameTime = GameTime or 20 * 60 * 1000 -- 20 minutes\nNow = Now or undefined -- Current time, updated on every message.\n\n-- Token information for player stakes.\nUNIT = 1000\nPaymentToken = PaymentToken or \"ADDR\"  -- Token address\nPaymentQty = PaymentQty or tostring(math.floor(UNIT))    -- Quantity of tokens for registration\nBonusQty = BonusQty or tostring(math.floor(UNIT))        -- Bonus token quantity for winners\n\n-- Players waiting to join the next game and their payment status.\nWaiting = Waiting or {}\n-- Active players and their game states.\nPlayers = Players or {}\n-- Number of winners in the current game.\nWinners = 0\n-- Processes subscribed to game announcements.\nListeners = Listeners or {}\n-- Minimum number of players required to start a game.\nMinimumPlayers = MinimumPlayers or 2\n\n-- Default player state initialization.\nPlayerInitState = PlayerInitState or {}\n\n-- Sends a state change announcement to all registered listeners.\n-- @param event: The event type or name.\n-- @param description: Description of the event.\nfunction announce(event, description)\n    for ix, address in pairs(Listeners) do\n        ao.send({\n            Target = address,\n            Action = \"Announcement\",\n            Event = event,\n            Data = description\n        })\n    end\n    return print(Colors.gray .. \"Announcement: \" ..

Now, let's further enhance its capabilities by adding a counterattack feature, allowing it to instantly retaliate against an opponent's attack, potentially catching them off-guard before they can retreat to safety.\n\n## Writing the code\n\nAdd the following handler to your `bot.lua` file and you're set:\n\n```lua\n-- Handler to automatically attack when hit by another player.\nHandlers.add(\n  \"ReturnAttack\",\n  { Action = \"Hit\" },\n  function (msg)\n      local playerEnergy = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id].energy\n      if playerEnergy == undefined then\n        print(\"Unable to read energy.\")\n        ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"Attack-Failed\", Reason = \"Unable to read energy.\"})\n      elseif playerEnergy == 0 then\n        print(\"Player has insufficient energy.\")\n        ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"Attack-Failed\", Reason = \"Player has no energy.\"})\n      else\n        print(\"Returning attack.\")\n        ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(playerEnergy)})\n      end\n      InAction = false\n      ao.send({Target = ao.id, Action = \"Tick\"})\n  end\n)\n```\n\nWhenever your player is under attack you receive a message with the Action `Hit`. This setup ensures your agent can make a swift counter attack, given it has sufficient energy.\n\nYou can refer to the latest code for `bot.lua` in the dropdown below:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Updated bot.lua file</strong></summary>\n\n```lua\nLatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil\n\nfunction inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)\n  return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range\nend\n\nfunction decideNextAction()\n  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]\n  local targetInRange = false\n\n  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do\n    if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then\n        targetInRange = true\n        break\n    end\n  end\n\n  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then\n    print(\"Player in range. Attacking.\")\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(player.energy)})\n  else\n    print(\"No player in range or insufficient energy.

This feature showcases the agent's evolving strategic depth and autonomy. In the upcoming section, we'll consolidate all the knowledge we've gathered so far and add some features for optimization.\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/bringing-together.md\n```\n# Bringing it Together\n\nThis final guide wraps up our series, where you've built up an autonomous agent piece by piece. Now, let's refine your agent with some optimizations that fine-tune its operations. Here's a quick overview of the key improvements made:\n\n- **Sequential Command Execution:** The introduction of an `InAction` flag ensures that your agent's actions are sequential (next action occurs only when the previous is successfully executed). This critical addition prevents your agent from acting on outdated game states, enhancing its responsiveness and accuracy. The full implementation can be found in the final code for the `bot.lua` file below.\n\n```lua\nInAction = InAction or false -- Prevents the agent from taking multiple actions at once.\n```\n\n- **Dynamic State Updates and Decisions:** The agent now employs an automatic tick logic, allowing for dynamic updates and decisions. This logic enables the agent to self-trigger state updates and make subsequent decisions either upon receiving a Tick message or upon completing an action, promoting autonomous operation.\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\"GetGameStateOnTick\", { Action = \"Tick\" }, function ()\n  if not InAction then\n    InAction = true\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\"})\n  end\nend)\n```\n\n- **Automated Fee Transfer:** To further streamline its operation and ensure uninterrupted participation in games, the autonomous agent now autonomously handles the transfer of confirmation fees.\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\"AutoPay\", { Action = \"AutoPay\" }, function ()\n  ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"Transfer\", Recipient = Game, Quantity = \"1000\"})\nend)\n```\n\nIn addition to these features, we've also added a logging function for debugging purposes and colored prints for better comprehension of game events. These enhancements collectively make your autonomous agent more efficient and adaptable in the game environment.\n\nCheck out the complete bot.lua code in the dropdown below, with all new additions highlighted accordingly:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Updated bot.lua file</strong></summary>\n\n```lua\n-- Initializing global variables to store the latest game state and game host process.\nLatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil\nInAction = InAction or false -- Prevents the agent from taking multiple actions at once.\n\nLogs = Logs or {}\n\ncolors = {\n  red = \"\\27[31m\",\n  green = \"\\27[32m\",\n  blue = \"\\27[34m\",\n  reset = \"\\27[0m\",\n  gray = \"\\27[90m\"\n}\n\nfunction addLog(msg, text) -- Function definition commented for performance, can be used for debugging\n  Logs[msg] = Logs[msg] or {}\n  table.insert(Logs[msg], text)\nend\n\n-- Checks if two points are within a given range.\n-- @param x1, y1: Coordinates of the first point.\n-- @param x2, y2: Coordinates of the second point.\n-- @param range: The maximum allowed distance between the points.\n-- @return: Boolean indicating if the points are within the specified range.\nfunction inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)\n    return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range\nend\n\n-- Decides the next action based on player proximity and energy.\n-- If any player is within range, it initiates an attack; otherwise, moves randomly.\nfunction decideNextAction()\n  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]\n  local targetInRange = false\n\n  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do\n      if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then\n          targetInRange = true\n          break\n      end\n  end\n\n  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then\n    print(colors.red .. \"Player in range.

It's time to apply these insights into the game world. Understand the game's intricacies and leverage your agent's capabilities to dominate the arena. But there's more to come.\n\nIn future sections, we'll dive deeper into the game arena, offering advanced strategies to elevate your agent's performance. Ready to take on the challenge? Let's see what you can create! 🕹️\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/build-game.md\n```\n---\nnext:\n  text: \"Guides\"\n  link: \"/guides/index\"\n---\n\n# Expanding the Arena\n\nWelcome to the final guide of Chapter 2, where you'll learn to build your own game on top of the arena framework introduced in the [previous tutorial](arena-mechanics). In this guide, we'll take you through the process of creating the [\"ao-effect\" game](ao-effect), which you experienced at the beginning of this chapter. As you progress through this example, you'll gain insights into structuring your game's logic and interacting with the arena's core code.\n\nWhether you're a seasoned developer or an aspiring game creator, this guide will empower you to unleash your creativity and bring your unique game ideas to life within the `aos` environment.\n\n## Setting up the Development Environment\n\nStart by creating a new file named `ao-effect.lua` in your preferred directory.\n\n> [!Note]\n> Ideally, this file should be placed in the same directory where your game process runs to ease the loading of the code. Else, you'll need to use relative paths to access the file.\n\n## Writing the Code\n\nNow, let's dive into the logic.\n\nYou'll notice that your game logic will involve calling functions and variables defined in the arena's logic. This showcases the power of composability, where your game builds on top of the existing arena logic, allowing seamless integration of variables and functions between the two. Because both logic become part of a unified logic for the game process.\n\n### Initializing Game Mechanics\n\nFirst, define essential variables and functions that set the stage for your game's mechanics:\n\n```lua\n-- AO EFFECT: Game Mechanics for AO Arena Game\n\n-- Game grid dimensions\nWidth = 40 -- Width of the grid\nHeight = 40 -- Height of the grid\nRange = 1 -- The distance for blast effect\n\n-- Player energy settings\nMaxEnergy = 100 -- Maximum energy a player can have\nEnergyPerSec = 1 -- Energy gained per second\n\n-- Attack settings\nAverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill = 3 -- Average number of hits to eliminate a player\n\n-- Initializes default player state\n-- @return Table representing player's initial state\nfunction playerInitState()\n    return {\n        x = math.random(Width/8),\n        y = math.random(Height/8),\n        health = 100,\n        energy = 0\n    }\nend\n\n-- Function to incrementally increase player's energy\n-- Called periodically to update player energy\nfunction onTick()\n    if GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then return end  -- Only active during \"Playing\" state\n\n    if LastTick == undefined then LastTick = Now end\n\n    local Elapsed = Now - LastTick\n    if Elapsed >= 1000 then  -- Actions performed every second\n        for player, state in pairs(Players) do\n            local newEnergy = math.floor(math.min(MaxEnergy, state.energy + (Elapsed * EnergyPerSec // 2000)))\n            state.energy = newEnergy\n        end\n        LastTick = Now\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThis code initializes your game's mechanics, including grid dimensions, player energy, and attack settings. The `playerInitState` function sets up the initial state for players when the game begins.\n\n### Player Movement\n\nNext, add the code for player movement:\n\n```lua\n-- Handles player movement\n-- @param msg: Message request sent by player with movement direction and player info\nfunction move(msg)\n    local playerToMove = msg.From\n    local direction = msg.Tags.Direction\n\n    local directionMap = {\n        Up = {x = 0, y = -1}, Down = {x = 0, y = 1},\n        Left = {x = -1, y = 0}, Right = {x = 1, y = 0},\n        UpRight = {x = 1, y = -1}, UpLeft = {x = -1, y = -1},\n        DownRight = {x = 1, y = 1}, DownLeft = {x = -1, y = 1}\n    }\n\n    -- calculate and update new coordinates\n    if directionMap[direction] then\n        local newX = Players[playerToMove].x + directionMap[direction].x\n        local newY = Players[playerToMove].y + directionMap[direction].y\n\n        -- updates player coordinates while checking for grid boundaries\n        Players[playerToMove].x = (newX - 1) % Width + 1\n        Players[playerToMove].y = (newY - 1) % Height + 1\n\n        announce(\"Player-Moved\", playerToMove .. \" moved to \" .. Players[playerToMove].x .. \",\" .. Players[playerToMove].y .. \".\")\n    else\n        ao.send({Target = playerToMove, Action = \"Move-Failed\", Reason = \"Invalid direction.\"})\n    end\n    onTick()  -- Optional: Update energy each move\nend\n```\n\nThe `move` function calculates new player coordinates based on the chosen direction while ensuring that players remain within the grid boundaries. Player movement adds dynamic interaction to your game and is announced to all players and listeners.\n\n### Player Attacks\n\nThen you must implement the logic for player attacks:\n\n```lua\n-- Handles player attacks\n-- @param msg: Message request sent by player with attack info and player state\nfunction attack(msg)\n    local player = msg.From\n    local attackEnergy = tonumber(msg.Tags.AttackEnergy)\n\n    -- get player coordinates\n    local x = Players[player].x\n    local y = Players[player].y\n\n    -- check if player has enough energy to attack\n    if Players[player].energy < attackEnergy then\n        ao.send({Target = player, Action = \"Attack-Failed\", Reason = \"Not enough energy.\"})\n        return\n    end\n\n    -- update player energy and calculate damage\n    Players[player].energy = Players[player].energy - attackEnergy\n    local damage = math.floor((math.random() * 2 * attackEnergy) * (1/AverageMaxStrengthHitsToKill))\n\n    announce(\"Attack\", player .. \" has launched a \" .. damage .. \" damage attack from \" .. x .. \",\" .. y .. \"!\")\n\n    -- check if any player is within range and update their status\n    for target, state in pairs(Players) do\n        if target ~= player and inRange(x, y, state.x, state.y, Range) then\n            local newHealth = state.health - damage\n            if newHealth <= 0 then\n                eliminatePlayer(target, player)\n            else\n                Players[target].health = newHealth\n                ao.send({Target = target, Action = \"Hit\", Damage = tostring(damage), Health = tostring(newHealth)})\n                ao.send({Target = player, Action = \"Successful-Hit\", Recipient = target, Damage = tostring(damage), Health = tostring(newHealth)})\n            end\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n-- Helper function to check if a target is within range\n-- @param x1, y1: Coordinates of the attacker\n-- @param x2, y2: Coordinates of the potential target\n-- @param range: Attack range\n-- @return Boolean indicating if the target is within range\nfunction inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)\n    return x2 >= (x1 - range) and x2 <= (x1 + range) and y2 >= (y1 - range) and y2 <= (y1 + range)\nend\n```\n\nThe `attack` function calculates damage based on attack energy, checks player energy, and updates player health accordingly. Player attacks add the competitive element in your game, allowing players to engage with each other.

The sky's the limit! ⌃◦🚀\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/decisions.md\n```\n# Strategic Decisions\n\nWith the [latest game state](game-state) at your disposal, your bot can evolve into an `autonomous agent`. This transition marks an upgrade in functionality, enabling not just reactions to game states but strategic actions that consider context, energy, and proximity to make decisions.\n\n## Writing the Code\n\nReturn to your `bot.lua` file and add the following functions:\n\n```lua\n-- Determines proximity between two points.\nfunction inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)\n    return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range\nend\n\n-- Strategically decides on the next move based on proximity and energy.\nfunction decideNextAction()\n  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]\n  local targetInRange = false\n\n  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do\n      if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then\n          targetInRange = true\n          break\n      end\n  end\n\n  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then\n    print(\"Player in range. Attacking.\")\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(player.energy)})\n  else\n    print(\"No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.\")\n    local directionMap = {\"Up\", \"Down\", \"Left\", \"Right\", \"UpRight\", \"UpLeft\", \"DownRight\", \"DownLeft\"}\n    local randomIndex = math.random(#directionMap)\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\", Player = ao.id, Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]})\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe `decideNextAction` function is now a testament to our agent's ability to think and act based on a comprehensive understanding of its environment. It analyzes the latest game state to either attack if you have sufficient energy and an opponent is `inRange` or move otherwise.\n\nNow all you need is a handler to make sure this function runs on its own.\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\n  \"decideNextAction\",\n  { Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" },\n  function ()\n    if LatestGameState.GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then\n      return\n    end\n    print(\"Deciding next action.\")\n    decideNextAction()\n  end\n)\n```\n\nThis handler triggers upon receiving a message that the latest game state has been fetched and updated. An action is taken only when the game is in `Playing` mode.\n\nYou can refer to the latest code for `bot.lua` in the dropdown below:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Updated bot.lua file</strong></summary>\n\n```lua\nLatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil\n\nfunction inRange(x1, y1, x2, y2, range)\n    return math.abs(x1 - x2) <= range and math.abs(y1 - y2) <= range\nend\n\nfunction decideNextAction()\n  local player = LatestGameState.Players[ao.id]\n  local targetInRange = false\n\n  for target, state in pairs(LatestGameState.Players) do\n      if target ~= ao.id and inRange(player.x, player.y, state.x, state.y, 1) then\n          targetInRange = true\n          break\n      end\n  end\n\n  if player.energy > 5 and targetInRange then\n    print(\"Player in range. Attacking.\")\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerAttack\", Player = ao.id, AttackEnergy = tostring(player.energy)})\n  else\n    print(\"No player in range or insufficient energy. Moving randomly.\")\n    local directionMap = {\"Up\", \"Down\", \"Left\", \"Right\", \"UpRight\", \"UpLeft\", \"DownRight\", \"DownLeft\"}\n    local randomIndex = math.random(#directionMap)\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"PlayerMove\", Player = ao.id, Direction = directionMap[randomIndex]})\n  end\nend\n\nHandlers.add(\n\"HandleAnnouncements\",\n{ Action = \"Announcement\" },\nfunction (msg)\n  ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\"})\n  print(msg.Event .. \": \" .. msg.Data)\nend\n)\n\nHandlers.add(\n\"UpdateGameState\",\n{ Action = \"GameState\" },\nfunction (msg)\n  local json = require(\"json\")\n  LatestGameState = json.decode(msg.Data)\n  ao.send({Target = ao.id, Action = \"UpdatedGameState\"})\nend\n)\n\nHandlers.add(\n\"decideNextAction\",\n{ Action = \"UpdatedGameState\" },\nfunction ()\n  if LatestGameState.GameMode ~= \"Playing\" then\n    return\n  end\n  print(\"Deciding next action.\")\n  decideNextAction()\nend\n)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Loading and Testing\n\nOnce again, to test out the latest upgrades, load the file in your aos player terminal as follows:\n\n```lua\n.load bot.lua\n```\n\nObserve your process output to see the decisions your autonomous agent makes in real-time, leveraging the current game state for strategic advantage. But what if another player attacks you and runs away while you are deciding the next move? In the next section you'll learn to automatically counter as soon as you have been attacked 🤺\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/game-state.md\n```\n# Fetching Game State\n\nNow that you're seeing game announcements directly in your terminal, you have a better grasp of the game's dynamics. However, these insights are limited to specific actions occurring within the game.\n\nWouldn't it be more useful to have on-demand access to comprehensive game data, like the positions, health, and energy of all players? This information could significantly improve your strategic planning, helping you assess threats, opportunities, and timing more effectively.\n\nIf you thought of adding another handler to the bot created in the [previous guide](announcements), you're absolutely right!\n\n## Writing the Code\n\nGo back to your `bot.lua` file and update your existing handler as follows:\n\n```lua\nHandlers.add(\n  \"HandleAnnouncements\",\n  { Action = \"Announcement\" },\n  function (msg)\n    ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\"})\n    print(msg.Event .. \": \" .. msg.Data)\n  end\n)\n```\n\nAdjustments to your handler include:\n\n- Renaming to `\"HandleAnnouncements\"` to reflect its broader role.\n- Addition of an extra operation to request the game for the updated state. The game is designed to respond to the `GetGameState` action tag.\n\nWhen you get a print of the announcement, you can check the latest message in your `Inbox` as follows:\n\n```lua\nInbox[#Inbox]\n```\n\nThe `Data` field of this message contains the latest state of the game which includes:\n\n- `GameMode` : Whether the game is in `Waiting` or `Playing` state.\n- `TimeRemaining` : The time remaining for the game to start or end.\n- `Players` : A table containing every player's stats like position, health and energy.\n\nBut this can be taken a step further so that you can not just read but also use information from the latest state for other automations.\n\nLet's define a new variable that stores the latest state as follows:\n\n```lua\nLatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil\n```\n\nThe syntax preserves existing values of the variable when you load successive iterations of the `bot.lua` file in your terminal, instead of overwriting it. If there is no pre-existing value then a `nil` value is assigned to the variable.\n\nThen implement another handler as follows:\n\n```lua\n-- Handler to update the game state upon receiving game state information.\nHandlers.add(\n  \"UpdateGameState\",\n  { Action = \"Announcement\" },\n  function (msg)\n    local json = require(\"json\")\n    LatestGameState = json.decode(msg.Data)\n    ao.send({Target = ao.id, Action = \"UpdatedGameState\"})\n    print(\"Game state updated. Print \\'LatestGameState\\' for detailed view.\")\n  end\n)\n```\n\nThe response from the game process from the previous handler has an action tag with the value `GameState` that helps us trigger this second handler. Once triggered, the handle function loads the in-built `json` package that parses the data into json and stores it in the `LatestGameState` variable.\n\nThis handler additionally sends a message to your process indicating when the state has been updated. The significance of this feature will be explained in the following section.\n\nYou can refer to the latest code for `bot.lua` in the dropdown below:\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Updated bot.lua file</strong></summary>\n\n```lua\nLatestGameState = LatestGameState or nil\n\nHandlers.add(\n\"HandleAnnouncements\",\n{ Action = \"Announcement\" },\nfunction (msg)\n  ao.send({Target = Game, Action = \"GetGameState\"})\n  print(msg.Event .. \": \" .. msg.Data)\nend\n)\n\nHandlers.add(\n\"UpdateGameState\",\n{ Action = \"GameState\" },\nfunction (msg)\n  local json = require(\"json\")\n  LatestGameState = json.decode(msg.Data)\n  ao.send({Target = ao.id, Action = \"UpdatedGameState\"})\n  print(\"Game state updated. Print \\'LatestGameState\\' for detailed view.\")\nend\n)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Loading and Testing\n\nAs usual, to test this new feature, load the file in your aos player terminal as follows:\n\n```lua\n.load bot.lua\n```\n\nThen check the `LatestStateVariable` to see if it has updated correctly by simply passing its name as follows:\n\n```lua\nLatestGameState\n```\n\nWith real-time access to the latest state of the game you bot is equipped to make informed decisions decide your next action. Next let's try automating actions with the help of this data 🚶\n\n```\n\n## File: tutorials/bots-and-games/index.md\n```\n---\nprev:\n  text: \"Tokengating\"\n  link: \"../begin/tokengating\"\nnext:\n  text: \"Let's Play A Game!\"\n  link: \"./ao-effect\"\n---\n\n# Bots and Games\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Build your own unique bot to complete Quest 3 and earn 1000 CRED, then enter games like the [Grid](https://github.com/twilson63/grid) to earn testnet CRED 24/7!\n\nLeveraging insights from our previous chapter, this section will guide you through the realm of automation with bots in aos and the construction of games.

Just make sure you have:\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version 20+. (If you haven't yet installed it, check out [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to find instructions for your OS).\n- A code editor of your choice.\n\n## Installing aos\n\nOnce you have NodeJS on your machine, all you need to do is install aos and run it:\n\n```sh\nnpm i -g https://get_ao.g8way.io\n```\n\nAfter installation, we can simply run the command itself to start a new aos process!\n\n```sh\naos\n```\n\nYou authenticate yourself to your aos process using a keyfile. If you have an Arweave wallet you can specify it by adding a `--wallet [location]` flag. If you don't, a new keyfile will be generated and stored locally for you at `~/.aos.json`.\n\n## Welcome to the rabbit hole\n\nThe utility you just started is a local client, which is ready to relay messages for you to your new process inside the ao computer.\n\nAfter it connects, you should see the following:\n\n```lua\n          _____                   _______                   _____\n         /\\    \\                 /::\\    \\                 /\\    \\\n        /::\\    \\               /::::\\    \\               /::\\    \\\n       /::::\\    \\             /::::::\\    \\             /::::\\    \\\n      /::::::\\    \\           /::::::::\\    \\           /::::::\\    \\\n     /:::/\\:::\\    \\         /:::/~~\\:::\\    \\         /:::/\\:::\\    \\\n    /:::/__\\:::\\    \\       /:::/    \\:::\\    \\       /:::/__\\:::\\    \\\n   /::::\\   \\:::\\    \\     /:::/    / \\:::\\    \\      \\:::\\   \\:::\\    \\\n  /::::::\\   \\:::\\    \\   /:::/____/   \\:::\\____\\   ___\\:::\\   \\:::\\    \\\n /:::/\\:::\\   \\:::\\    \\ |:::|    |     |:::|    | /\\   \\:::\\   \\:::\\    \\\n/:::/  \\:::\\   \\:::\\____\\|:::|____|     |:::|    |/::\\   \\:::\\   \\:::\\____\\\n\\::/    \\:::\\  /:::/    / \\:::\\    \\   /:::/    / \\:::\\   \\:::\\   \\::/    /\n \\/____/ \\:::\\/:::/    /   \\:::\\    \\ /:::/    /   \\:::\\   \\:::\\   \\/____/\n          \\::::::/    /     \\:::\\    /:::/    /     \\:::\\   \\:::\\    \\\n           \\::::/    /       \\:::\\__/:::/    /       \\:::\\   \\:::\\____\\\n           /:::/    /         \\::::::::/    /         \\:::\\  /:::/    /\n          /:::/    /           \\::::::/    /           \\:::\\/:::/    /\n         /:::/    /             \\::::/    /             \\::::::/    /\n        /:::/    /               \\::/____/               \\::::/    /\n        \\::/    /                 ~~                      \\::/    /\n         \\/____/                                           \\/____/\n\nWelcome to AOS: Your operating system for AO, the decentralized open\naccess supercomputer.\n\nType \".load-blueprint chat\" to join the community chat and ask questions!\n\nAOS Client Version: 1.12.1. 2024\nType \"Ctrl-C\" twice to exit\n\nYour AOS process:  QFt5SR6UwJSCnmgnROq62-W8KGY9z96k1oExgn4uAzk\n\ndefault@aos-0.2.2[Inbox:1]>\n```\n\nWelcome to your new home in the ao computer! The prompt you are now looking at is your own personal server in this decentralized machine. We will be using it to play with and explore ao in the rest of this tutorial.\n\n## Sending your first command\n\nYour new personal aos process is a server that lives inside the computer, waiting to receive and execute your commands.\n\naos loves to make things simple, so it wants to hear commands from you in the Lua programming language. Don't know Lua? Don't panic! It is a super straightforward, friendly, and fun language. We will learn it as we progress through this series.\n\nLet's break the ice and type:\n\n```lua\naos> \"Hello, ao!\"\n```\n\nThen hit the \"[Enter]\" key. You should see your shell sign and post the message, request the result, then print the result as follows:\n\n```lua\n\"Hello, ao!\"\n```\n\n## Eh. What's the big deal?\n\nSent it a message to your process, permanently etched it into Arweave, then asked a distributed compute network to calculate its result.\n\nWhile the result might not _look_ revolutionary, in reality you have done something quite extraordinary. Your process is a _decentralized_ server that doesn't exist in any one particular place on Earth. It exists as data, replicated on Arweave between many different machines, distributed all over the world. If you wanted to, you could now attach a new compute unit to this process and recreate the state from its log of inputs (just your single command, for now) -- at any time in the future.\n\nThis makes your new shell process...\n\n- **Resilient**: There is no single place on Earth where your server actually resides. It is everywhere and nowhere -- immune from physical destruction or tampering of any kind.\n- **Permanent**: Your process will never disappear. It will always exist in its [✨holographic state✨ ](/concepts/holographic-state) on Arweave, allowing you to recall it and continue playing with it. A contribution has been made to Arweave's storage endowment, so that you never have to think about upkeep or maintenance payments again.\n- **Permissionless**: You did not have to register in order to start this server. Your right to use it is guaranteed by its underlying protocol (Arweave), no matter what Google, Amazon, or any other BigTech company says.\n- **Trustless**: The state of your server is _mathematically guaranteed_. This means that you -- and everyone else -- can trust it with certainty, without even having to trust the underlying hardware it runs on. This property lets you build trustless _services_ on top: Code that runs without any privileged owner or controller, ruled purely by math.\n\nThere is so much more to it, but these are the basics. Welcome to the ao computer, newbie! We are grateful to have you. 🫡\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn the tutorials that follow, we will explore ao and build everything from chatrooms to autonomous, decentralized bots.
